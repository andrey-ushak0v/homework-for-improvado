This section will provide an overview of how to build Salesforce dashboards and discuss three popular creation methods.Use Salesforceâs built-in dashboard functionalityOne of the most effective ways to build a Salesforce dashboard is to utilize the platform's built-in dashboard functionality. With various chart types available, including bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, funnel charts, scatter charts, tables, and cards, you can design a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that caters to your business needs.To start creating a dashboard in Salesforce, follow these steps:Prepare your reports: Before creating a dashboard, you must have your reports ready. Reports in Salesforce are the foundation of dashboards, as they provide the data visualized in the dashboard components. To create a report, navigate to the 'Reports' tab in Salesforce, click 'New Report,' and select the report type based on the data you want to analyze. Customize the report by adding filters, grouping, and sorting the data as needed. Save the report once it's complete.Navigate to Dashboards: Click on 'Dashboards' in the top menu. From there, you can edit an existing dashboard's components or create a new one.Create a new dashboard: To create a new dashboard, select the 'New Dashboard' option toward the top right.Customize your dashboard: Add components to your dashboard by clicking on 'Add Component.' Choose the appropriate chart type based on the data you want to visualize and the insights you want to communicate. Link each component to the relevant report you created in step 1.Save your dashboard: Once you have added and customized all the necessary components, save your dashboard. It's now ready for you and your team to view and analyze the data.Remember that building an effective Salesforce dashboard relies on your creativity and understanding of the data you're working with. Using Salesforce's built-in dashboard functionality, you can create visually appealing and informative dashboards that help your team monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. However, there are a few limitations to consider when using built-in Salesforce dashboards:Limited data sources: The built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality primarily supports data from the Salesforce platform. If you need to visualize data from external sources, you may face challenges integrating and displaying that information.Restricted customization options: While Salesforce offers a variety of chart types and components, the customization options may not be as extensive or flexible as those available in specialized data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau.Scalability issues: As your business grows and the complexity of your data increases, you might encounter limitations in the built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality, which could hinder your ability to create and manage multiple dashboards efficiently.Manual data management: Although Salesforce provides tools for managing and updating data, the process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially if you're working with large datasets or must combine data from multiple sources.By using a solution like Improvado, you can overcome these limitations. Improvado pulls data from 500+ sales and marketing data sources (including Salesforce) and aggregates disparate datasets with each other. This enables marketing and sales teams to build a holistic dashboard that provides clear-cut insights into the companyâs revenue generation efforts. This way, you can maximize the potential of your dashboards and ensure that your team has access to the most accurate, comprehensive, and actionable insights into marketing and sales effort. Schedule a quick consultation to discuss your analytics goals and learn how Improvado can get you there. Create dashboards with Einstein AnalyticsEinstein Analytics is a tool within Salesforce that allows users to create interactive dashboards. By leveraging its different types of tables, including Values Table, Pivot Table, and Compare Table, users can go beyond traditional charts and widgets to provide more comprehensive insights into their data.To create a dashboard with Einstein Analytics, follow these steps:Navigate to the Einstein Analytics platform within Salesforce.Click "Create" and select "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.Start by adding a chart, widget, or one of the three tables available in Einstein Analytics.Values Table: Provides supporting details for a chart, allowing users to drill down into the data.Pivot Table: Summarizes datasets and presents them from a different perspective, ideal for summary data.Compare Table: Allows for comparing different data types with unique filters for different columns.Customize the table or chart by applying filters, modifying the appearance, or adding interactivity through faceting or bindings.If needed, use Salesforce Analytics Query Language (SAQL) to modify the query further or make changes that can't be achieved through the point-and-click interface.Arrange your tables, charts, and widgets to create a visually appealing and insightful dashboard layout.Save the dashboard and share it with the relevant stakeholders.Although Einstein Analytics offers an effective way to create dashboards, there are some downsides to consider:Complexity: Due to its advanced features and capabilities, Einstein Analytics can be complicated to navigate for users without prior analytics or technical experience. This may lead to a steep learning curve for some team members.Time-consuming: Building and customizing dashboards with Einstein Analytics can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets.By using Improvado, you can overcome these challenges, as it helps to aggregate data across Salesforce and 500 other marketing and sales data sources and offers seamless flow of data to any dashboarding tool.

Should you have an advertising strategy for LinkedIn? Is TikTok strictly for brands targeting Gen Z, or has it gone mainstream? Is Twitter still relevant in the wake of all the recent company changes?Â One platform many businesses have overlooked in recent years is Pinterest, a visually engaging platform bursting with potential. Pinterest has over 450 million monthly active users, and 45% of its US user base has a household income of over $100K. Shopping and link-clicking are common occurrences on the platform, and many people use the app specifically to get inspiration for purchases.Â If your brand decides to take the leap and advertise on Pinterest, youâll need a Pinterest ads dashboard. When it comes to paid advertising, knowing how your campaigns are performing can help you optimize them for lower CPA and tweak messaging to attract more leads. This article offers an overview of Pinterest analytics and explains how you can visualize your Pinterest metrics in a cohesive and easily digestible way.What Are Pinterest Ads?Like many other social media platforms, Pinterest allows you to run paid ad campaigns. Since Pinterest is entirely visual, the ads are, too. That might mean custom infographics, digital designs, photography, or videos. Whatever your chosen visual medium, Pinterest ads can place your product or service in front of new audiences.Â Marketing on Pinterest is different from most social platforms. Unlike Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok, itâs much less focused on âsocialâ interactions and more concentrated on the user experience. People use Pinterest to get inspired for a new project, to shop for their next purchase, and to curate and save content for personal consumption later.Â This might be a significant advantage for your brand. Research into Pinterestâs general audience insights shows that 83% of weekly users made a purchase based on the content they saw from brands on the platform. What should you take away from that? Well, Pinterest users arenât always passive scrollers (as is more common on other social media apps). Most of the time, they seek inspiration from people and brands.Â Accelerate Pinterest analytics with Improvadoâs dashboardBook a callThe Basics of Pinterest Ads AnalyticsPaid advertising on Pinterest can be a great way to get your brand in front of more people. People often use search engines for online queries, but theyâre also on social media for long periods. 59% of the world uses social media for an average of two and a half hours daily. Getting your ads on their feeds during that time can be incredibly valuable.Â Â Because the intention behind Pinterest differs from other platforms, there is some specific terminology to be aware of.Â Pin: A pin is a visual post on Pinterest. Usually, itâs an image, graphic, or video. You can think of pins like actual visuals youâd pin to a virtual corkboard, but more organized.Â Repins: When someone repins your pin, theyâve saved it to their own board(s). On other platforms, repins are often called â saves.âÂ Outbound clicks: Your ads will be pins with outbound links attached (probably your CTA). Outbound clicks are when users click into your pin and then through to your link.Pin clicks: Pins are displayed on Pinterest usersâ feeds in a grid formation. To get a closer look, users can click on the pin itself. When they do, itâs counted as a pin click.âLike any successful social media advertising campaign, you must keep tabs on how your ads perform. If done right, measuring social media data can significantly expand your business.Â Typically, marketers that run Pinterest campaigns use Pinterestâs in-app analytics. Itâs a viable option if Pinterest is your primary advertising platform. Internal analytics shows you all the crucial metrics across all your pinterest campaigns. And, while this analytics solution grants a fairly deep level of visibility into Pinterest campaigns, it doesnât show you how your Pinterest campaigns impact your overall cross-channel marketing efforts.A limited scope of Pinterest-specific metrics is usually insufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global marketing performance. Plus, built-in Pinterest dashboard isnât compatible with a other platformsâ analytics tools, making it difficult to compare data across channels.Â Given that the Pinterest in-app analytics doesnât provide the flexibility to create customized reports tailored to your marketing objectives, this solution lags far behind custom dashboards for cross-channel analysis.Of course, there are always marketersâ favorite spreadsheets. However, they quickly get complex and challenging to assemble and read when you start populating them with performance data from multiple platforms.Â So, whatâs the most efficient solution to track Pinterest campaign performance and, at the same time, understand how they synergize with the rest of your marketing efforts? Enter the Pinterest ads dashboard.Â The Benefits of a Pinterest Ads DashboardA Pinterest ads dashboard is a marketing analytics tool that visually displays your Pinterest insights. Many people use marketing dashboards across multiple channels and platforms to visualize their KPIs and other crucial metrics. These dashboards provide an overview of everything you need to see about your paid advertising efforts in an easily digestible format.Â You can select any metrics youâd like to track and use visual graphs, charts, and more to display them.Â Whatâs even more important is that such a dashboard facilitates marketing performance tracking across different platforms and acts a single source of truth for all your cross-channel marketing efforts. There are several benefits to consider when building a dashboard, but here are the top three.1. Enables ProductivityÂ The key to running a successful marketing team is generating more productivity without increasing workload; dashboards can do just that.Â A Pinterest ads dashboard automates data collection, transforms raw performance metrics into insights, and visualizes your insights to make them easily understandable for everyone. This takes a heavy weight off your teamâs shoulders, allowing marketers to spend more time experimenting with new campaigns and analyzing insights instead of crunching numbers in spreadsheets.2. Provides Greater TransparencyAnalytics dashboards create a central hub of information that anyone can use to guide their decisions and evaluate the marketingâs team performance. This makes it easier for different departments to stay on the same page and makes the marketing team more accountable for the ad spend and campaign performance.Â 3. Standardizes MetricsBy aggregating data from various platforms, a custom dashboard can standardize metrics, enabling easy comparison of performance across channels. When gathering metrics manually, marketers have to remove duplicate data entries, verify that metricsâ naming conventions match each other, join disparate data tables, and more.Â An automated Pinterest Ads dashboard takes care of these tasks. By aggregating marketing data from Pinterest and other marketing platforms of your choice, you get a holistic view of your marketing efforts. Conversions that happened outside of Pinterest wonât slip away from your analytics and you can easily attribute each marketing dollar spent to a conversion, acquired traffic, or purchases.Â 4. Fuels Decision-MakingConcrete data fuels successful strategies. Data collection and analysis is often a business bottleneck, but marketing dashboards simplify it. Custom Pinterest dashboards are designed to include advanced analytical tools, such as attribution modeling, forecasting, and trend analysis, which provide deeper insights into marketing performance. You can use your insights from your Pinterest ads dashboard to improve campaigns and strategies.Â Get Improvadoâs Pinterest Ads dashboardShare some details about your case and set a date to discuss it with an Improvado product expert.

Take time to identify your KPIs for specific campaigns and decide which to include in your dashboard. Here are a few to get you started.1. ImpressionsTracking your impressions on Pinterest is important, as it tells you how many people have viewed your ads. At its core, impressions are a vital metric that says a lot about your campaign health.Â For example, if an ad is generating a high number of impressions but not converting well, you may need to reassess your targeting or creative strategy. Conversely, if an ad is generating fewer impressions but converting well, you might consider increasing its budget to reach a larger audience.Besides, impressions serve as a basis for calculating other important engagement metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), engagement rate, and cost per impression (CPI). By measuring these metrics, you can gain insights into how well your audience is interacting with your ads, helping you optimize your campaigns for better results.2. Click-Through Rate (CTR)Your CTR lets you know how many users click on your pins and then click through to your outbound links. A higher CTR indicates that your ad is resonating well with your target audience, encouraging them to take action. Monitoring CTR helps you gauge the effectiveness of your ad creatives, headlines, and CTAs.This is vital information for tracking the conversion path.Additionally, platforms like Pinterest use ad performance metrics, including CTR, to determine the quality of your ads. A higher CTR may lead to a higher quality score, which in turn can result in better ad placements and lower costs.3. Cost-Per-Click (CPC)Paid advertising can be pricey, so keeping tabs on your ads' costs is essential. Your CPC will tell you how much each click costs you. When compared to the other metrics on the dashboard, the CPC can help you decide the value of that price.And, whatâs more, monitoring CPC allows you to calculate your return on ad spend by comparing the revenue generated from conversions to the cost of acquiring those clicks. This information is crucial for determining the overall profitability of your ad campaigns and making data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing strategy.Also, Tracking CPC helps you assess your campaign performance in relation to your competitors. By monitoring industry benchmarks and comparing your CPC to industry averages, you can determine if your ads are performing well within your niche and identify areas for improvement. Pinterestâs CPC averages $0.5 - $1.5 per click, so keep this in mind when measuring your CPC.4. Cost-Per-Mile (CPM)Similarly, your CPM tells you how much 1,000 impressions costs. This metric can help provide a big-picture view of the ROI of your campaign. CPM is directly related to your bidding strategy. By tracking CPM, you can identify if your bid is too high or too low, allowing you to adjust your bids to find the optimal balance between cost and visibility.Average CPM on Pinterest lies in the range of $2 - $5 per thousand impressions.Â 5. Ad SpendAd Spend tells you how much youâre spending on your paid advertising overall. Regularly tracking ad spend allows you to detect any sudden spikes in costs or anomalies in your campaigns. Identifying these issues early on enables you to make adjustments to prevent overspending and maintain control over your advertising budget.Also, by monitoring ad spend over time, you can identify seasonal trends or shifts in your target audience's behavior. This information can help you adjust your campaigns accordingly to capitalize on these trends and improve your campaign performance.6. Engagement RateThis metric is crucial to understanding the success of your campaigns. It can include data such as repins, comments, likes, and more.Â Ads with high engagement rates are more likely to be saved or shared by users, increasing the potential for virality and extending the reach of your campaigns organically. Tracking engagement rate can help you identify ads with high viral potential and optimize your campaigns to maximize organic reach.Besides, you can tweak you content strategy for ad campaigns depending on the type of content that performs best (video, photos, images with texts, etc.).7. Conversion RateTracking conversions is a critical part of any marketing campaign, and it isnât any different on Pinterest. Your conversion rate tells you how many ad views convert into customers.Â Drive Higher ROAS with an Improvado-Built Pinterest Ads DashboardÂ As it comes clear, there are multiple ways to track Pinterest Ads performance, and all of them have their upsides and downsides.

The platform caught fire during the global pandemic and became a household name seemingly overnight. Initially, people used TikTok for memes and dancing videos, but today itâs become one of the largest social media platforms with the highest engagement rates among competitors.Marketers still trying to figure out Facebook ads when TikTok hit likely felt overwhelmed. Another social media account to manage? The feeling is valid, but TikTok is a whole new dimension for your companyâs marketing stack.Running ads on TikTok can be especially beneficial, and if you choose to do so, youâll need a TikTok ads dashboard to measure your success. This article will teach you the basics of TikTok ad analytics and how to build your custom dashboard.Get a TikTok Ads dashboard to streamline efficiency of your TikTok effortsBook a callIntroducing TikTok AdsTikTok has a colorful history and a flourishing user base. The app boasts over 1 billion monthly active users (as of the last quarter of 2022), many of whom are younger Millennials and Generation Z. For brands trying to target those demographics, TikTok is the place to be.Â TikTok ads work in much the same way as other social media platforms. Short-form video content is all that TikTok displays on their usersâ feeds, so you can create TikTok ads in that format and sponsor them to reach your target audience. Running TikTok ad campaigns is an excellent way to extend your current reach.Â Many social platforms allow you to tailor your ad campaigns to specific audiences, and TikTok is no exception, though they do have a surprisingly robust offering in this department. You can target viewers based on interests, demographics, and behaviors.TikTok Ads location targeting optionsFrom there, you can present your ad in viewersâ âFor Youâ feed, which is the curated selection of videos TikTokâs algorithm displays to users continuously.Â What Kinds of Ads Can You Run on TikTok?TikTok offers different types of paid advertising. The three main options are:Â In-feed ads This 9â15 second vertical ad on usersâ âFor Youâ page can also include a call to action (CTA). In-feed ads are the most common type of ad on TikTok. With the help of a clickable CTA button you can drive traffic towards external landing pages, app download pages, or to your organizationâs TikTok account.Â In-feed ads are a great opportunity to grab prospectsâ attention. 68% of users find Ads on TikTok unique and different from any other platform. Plus, these ads are undistinguishable from regular TikTok content, with a CTA being the only difference between two types of content. So, you have a chance to advertise your product or tell a story about your brand without users recognizing that it was an actual ad.Â However, if your ad creative isnât engaging enough or is overly salesy, users will most likely skip it immediately. Thatâs why you have to follow TikTok trends and fit into the feed with the right content to ensure the campaignâs success.Brand takeover ads With these ads, your video plays when a targeted user opens the app. If interested in your offering, they can click the ad, which will take them to your landing page. TikTok ensures users see only one brand takeover ad daily, limiting these positions.Â While brand takeover ads are certainly effective for raising awareness of your brand, product, or event, they might not be the best choice for TikTok Ads first timers because of their high price.Â Hashtag challengesBranded hashtag challenges are an advertising opportunity unique to TikTok, which makes your ads more exciting and engaging. These challenges prompt users to create videos showing themselves performing a specific action. This type of ad allows you to harness the power of User-Generated Content (UGC) and drive more awareness, leads, or credibility for your brand.The main advantage of the branded hashtag challenge is the potential scale and reach of your campaign. If executed properly, millions of users can catch the trend and create content that benefits your brand. Itâs impossible to achieve with regular influencer campaigns for example. This type of ad also boasts of 17 times higher engagement rates compared to regular campaigns across other platforms.TikTok does offer some additional options, but these three are the most commonly used.Â How Much Do TikTok Ads Cost?The cost of these ads will vary depending on the ad type, budget, targeting, and other factors. However, due to the nature and popularity of the app, itâs often more expensive than other social platforms like Facebook or Instagram.For example, regular in-feed ads start at 10$ per CPM. Besides, you have to spend at least $500 per campaign to advertise on TikTok.Â As per other ad types, TikTok hasnât been very transparent about the cost of advertising. However, marketers and influencers claim that a brand takeover campaign that ensures 5 mln+ impressions starts from $50,000 per day. The hashtag challenge might cost you $150,000 per week.What Is a TikTok Ads Dashboard?Reporting is an integral part of advertising on TikTok. Whether you need to measure the impact of your finished campaigns or optimize some of the ongoing ones, you always need to dive into performance metrics first.Typically, reporting isnât on the marketerâs high-priority list of tasks. They often copypaste metrics in a spreadsheet to get a high-level overview of the campaignâs performance. Then, everything is pretty straightforward. If the campaignâs ROAS is positive, the team launches it again. If the ROAS is negative, they ditch the campaign and come up with something new.However, a coherent reporting is crucial for TikTok Ads for several reasons:TikTok ad performance is harder to measure compared to regular display ads. For example, UGC campaigns usually take more time to deliver results, so marketers have to keep sharp eye on metrics and donât jump to conclusions.Large-scale TikTok campaigns are expensive, so teams have to take them responsibly and keep track of their marketing dollars.Thatâs where a TikTok ads dashboard comes in. Picture this: A single source of truth for performance data across all campaignsthat displays all KPIs in a visual, easily digestible format. Charts and graphs make it much easier to understand the results campaigns achieve and facilitate better communication.Â TikTok In-App Analytics vs. Cross-Channel DashboardsNaturally, many marketers rely on TikTokâs in-app dashboard. Itâs an automatic report with real-time updates and fundamental insights into your account. For marketing teams that use TikTok as their primary acquisition channel, this report might be enough. It shows all the crucial metrics and provides shows you whatâs working and whatâs not with your TikTok campaigns.However, things become much more complex when you have to report on performance across different ad platforms, website, paid search, and other channels.For example, your TikTok campaign sends prospects to your website after they click on your ad. TikTokâs in-app dashboard will only record the number of clicks generated by the campaign. If you need to go further and know how many visitors from your TikTok campaign turned into customers, youâll have to check this data in Google Analytics or any other web analytics tool you use.In case youâre running ads across multiple platforms, youâll have to use each platformâs dashboard and compare it with your web analytics data. Given that in-app dashboards often show metrics biased towards their platforms, the entire reporting process might turn into a nightmare.A cross-channel dashboard can save you 90% of the time you spend on manual reporting and protect you from invalid data that often pops up while drawing up your report manually.Marketing analytics platforms are designed to handle cross-channel reporting. Improvado, a leading platform for marketing and sales reporting, connects data from 500+ marketing and sales platforms to build a cross-channel dashboard tailoredÂ  to your use case. It allows you to prioritize marketing analytics by streamlining all manual reporting activities.

Building a custom TikTok dashboard is more of an investment than using in-app analytics, so you want to extract maximum value from it.Â Here are some essential TikTok metrics and KPIs to get you started.ImpressionsYou should include this standard metric on every dashboard. Impressions measure the number of people to whom youâve exposed your ad. Keep in mind that TikTok users often scroll endlessly, so they might see your ad several times, and each of these are counted as individual impressions.Return On Ad Spend (ROAS)Many brands forget to track their ROAS, but you shouldnât overlook this crucial metric. You can consider it a more specific extension of your ROI, as it measures the value of your ad spend dollars.Click-Through Rate (CTR)Your click-through rate measures the number of users that clicked on an ad to your landing page or desired external link. It's important to track this metric to gauge the effectiveness of your ads in driving traffic to your target destination. Dashboards display this data as a line chart to visualize trends over time.Cost Per Click (CPC)CPC on TikTok works the same as it does on other platforms. How much are clicks costing you on the platform? This metric lets you know.Â Conversion Rate (CR)Tracking your conversion rate is essential on every single platform you use for marketing. Itâs arguably the most critical metric since it tells you how many impressions youâve converted into customers.Â View TimeThis one shows the total time users spend watching your ads. It's important because it indicates how engaging your ads are to your target audience. View time is usually presented using a line chart to track changes in view time over a period, which can help identify trends and potential areas for improvement.Video Completion Rate (VCR)VCR measures the percentage of users who watched the entire ad. This metric indicates the effectiveness of the ad in retaining viewers' attention. VCR can be displayed as a percentage on a bar chart to easily compare different ads' performance.Engagement RateThe total number of actions (likes, comments, shares) on your ad divided by the number of views. A high engagement rate indicates that the ad is resonating with the audience. You can present engagement rate as a percentage on a bar chart to compare the performance of various ads.Cost per Engagement (CPE)CPE is the average cost of each engagement (like, comment, share) on your ad. Monitoring CPE helps to ensure your ads are generating valuable interactions at an acceptable cost. A line chart is ideal for tracking CPE over time and identifying trends.Bounce RateItâs not exactlyTikTok Ads metrics, but a crucial web analytics Bounce rate is the percentage of users who clicked on your ad but left your website after viewing only one page. A high bounce rate could indicate that the ad is not effectively targeting the right audience. Display bounce rate as a percentage on a bar chart to compare the performance of different ads.Automate TikTok Ads Dashboards and Reports With ImprovadoManual reporting and data entry takes much of your teamâs time and resources.

The right visualization can help you identify trends and insights more easily, making it easier to optimize your campaigns for maximum ROI. Here are some examples of visualizations that could be used in a Twitter Ads dashboard:Line chartsLine charts are a great way to visualize changes in a metric over time. For example, you could use a line chart to track changes in ad spend over the course of a month or quarter. This could help you identify trends in spending and adjust your budget accordingly.Heat mapsHeat maps are useful for visualizing geographic data. Heat maps might be used to visualize where ads are getting the most engagement. This could help you target your ads more effectively in specific regions.Bar chartsBar charts are useful for comparing different metrics side-by-side. For example, you could use a bar chart to compare the click-through rates (CTR) of different ad variations. This could help you identify which ads are performing best and adjust your campaigns accordingly.Scatter Plots Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two metrics.Hence, you can visualize the relationship between ad spend and post likes with the help of a scatter plot. This could help you identify whether there is a correlation between these two metrics and adjust your spending accordingly.When choosing a visualization type, it's important to consider the type of data you're working with and the insights you want to uncover. For example, if you want to identify trends over time, a line chart may be the best option. If you want to compare different metrics, a bar chart may be more effective. It's also important to choose a visualization type that is easy to read and understand, as this will help you communicate your insights to other stakeholders.Top 3 Benefits of a Twitter Ads DashboardTwitter reporting can be challenging because there are many key metrics to sort through. A dashboard solves that issue by streamlining and visualizing your data, making it easier to digest and report. Stakeholders grasp the results easier when in-house or outsourced marketing teams provide visuals.Beyond that, there are many other advantages to using a Twitter Ads dashboard. Here are the top three benefits of implementing a data visualization tool into your workflow.1. Improved Decision-MakingBusinesses across all industries understand the importance of data-driven strategies. Having a constant feedback loop thatâs visual, accessible, and user-friendly makes it easy to dive into data regularly.Â 2. Increased EfficiencyHaving a centralized data hub for your marketing channels is a game changer. Your team and stakeholders can access the same information at any time of day or night. This makes communication more efficient and strategy sessions more productive.Â If you automate the data collection process, youâll take things further and eradicate manual reporting. Automated dashboards can save your team 27% of their time.Â 3. Greater TransparencyTransparency fosters trust and a better awareness of results. Stakeholders (clients or higher-ups) not recognizing a campaignâs ROI is a common frustration for marketing teams. It can be easy to miss a few critical KPIs when combing through lengthy and complex spreadsheets.Â A Twitter Ads dashboard provides greater transparency across teams and facilitates more efficient communication.Â Why Built-In Twitter Analytics is Less than IdealEven though In-App Twitter analytics shows a lot of information regarding your Twitter Ads performance, it often fails to demonstrate a bigger picture of your marketing performance. Letâs figure out why this happens and what can be done to change it.Limited Cross-Channel VisibilityTwitter's in-app analytics only allows for analysis of data generated within the Twitter platform. This means that you can only see data related to your Twitter Ads campaigns and how they are performing within the Twitter platform.The reason for this limitation is that Twitter isnât designed to be a marketing analytics tool. You canât consolidate data from different sources in Twitter Ads Manager.Consequently, if you are running ads on Twitter and Facebook, you would need to use two in-app analytics tools to get a grasp of your marketing performance. Twitter's in-app analytics would only show you data related to your Twitter Ads campaigns, while Facebook's analytics tool would only show you data related to your Facebook Ads campaigns.There are certain differences in how each platform collects and analyzes data. Each platform maps data differently, has different naming conventions for their metrics, and a whole lot of other other differences. As a result, teams turn to using spreadsheets as a quick way to aggregate all performance metrics.Â More advanced marketing teams leverage marketing analytics platforms to consolidate marketing reporting.For example, enterprise-level teams use Improvado to automate their marketing analytics. Improvado integrates with  500+ marketing and sales platforms to pull together all your performance data and create a holistic picture of marketing performance. The platform transforms your insights into a cohesive, easily-digestible format that makes data readily available for analysis.

Without it, you canât understand which campaigns result in conversions and revenue, and which of them should optimized to get better results.Â Unfortunately, native Twitter analytics tools doesnât allow for effective marketing attribution. Yes, Twitter offers its own tracking pixel for website conversion tracking.Â However, it has some significant drawbacks. First of all, itâs yet another piece of custom code that you have to implement on your website. Considering that you already have Google Analytics tracking pixel, custom events, and various third-party software (e.g., a live chat app), Twitter Pixel will only degrade your website performance and increase webpage loading time.Secondly, Twitter Pixel is somewhat biased towards Twitter. Meaning, it might attribute more conversions to Twitter Ads than it really influenced. Itâs nothing new that discrepancies often occur between Google Analytics and ad vendors third-party tracking solutions. And the reason for these discrepancies is that tracking pixels arenât 100% precise and straightforward.Thatâs why itâs better to aim for marketing analytics platforms that donât require additional tracking pixels. For example, Improvado seamlessly integrates with your existing web analytics platform to track journeys and build user profiles. You can use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or any other pixel directly with Improvado.Â Get a product tour from the Improvado teamShare some details about your case and set a date to discuss it with an Improvado product expert.

Being intentional about which metrics to include is essential to gaining the most value from your dashboard.Â âHere are a few metrics to consider.Ad ClicksAs the name suggests, Ad Clicks count the number of times users click on your ads.Â Ad SpendThe Ad Spend metric monitors how much money youâve spent on paid ads. You can filter this data based on specific ad variations, campaign(s), or ad sets.Click-Through Rate (CTR)Â Your CTR is an essential metric for comparing the number of clicks your ad link received vs. the number of impressions.Â If your ad receives a lot of impressions (views) but only a few clicks, this could mean something is off with your campaign targeting.Â Cost Per Mille (CPM)Another valuable metric to track is your CPM, which tracks the cost of 1,000 ad impressions.Â Post LikesThough some might feel that likes are merely a vanity metric, they can be helpful to track if youâre looking to quantify engagement. You can measure the number of likes a specific tweet receives, or a designated set of tweets.Content EngagementContent Engagement offers a more holistic perspective by measuring all engagement results from your Twitter profile.How to Simplify Twitter Ads Tracking and Dashboard CreationManual reporting and data collection is a pain in the neck for every marketing team. While performance measurement is fundamental for every healthy marketing campaign, the time it takes to draw up a report renders the entire marketing analytics process unviable.However, it doesnât have to be that way.

Mind that youâre only paying for a click. If the prospect clicks on your listing and doesnât purchase you still have to pay for this click.You can set up any PPC ad campaign in just a few minutes.

Amazon Ads, as well as any other platform, offers quite a lot of metrics you can track. And, this often leads to a question âWhat am I looking at?â. So, selecting the right metrics is crucial to make the dashboard informative, and, at the same time, concise.Â Below are some of the most universally beneficial Amazon Advertising metrics to track on your dashboard report. Having a firm grasp on these metrics can help you set goals, strategize, and gain a competitive edge with your ad campaigns.ImpressionsYou might be familiar with impressions metrics from your Google PPC ads or social media advertising, which work in essentially the same way on Amazon. Impressions will show how many times Amazon displayed your ad to a customer.ClicksThis critical metric shows how often someone has clicked on your Amazon ad. If the idea of invalid clicks enters your mind, Amazon is one step ahead. They adjust the report for invalid clicks (accidental or otherwise) within three days, which is immensely helpful for accurate reporting.Â Average Cost of Sales (ACoS)This valuable metric measures the effectiveness of your sponsored ads. It represents the percentage of ad-generated sales spent through advertising. ACoS is one of those metrics that will go a long way with clients and stakeholders. It provides a quantifiable number to show them the value of their dollar.Â How to Manually Calculate ACoSTo calculate your ACoS, divide the amount you spent on ads by how much revenue your ads generated. In other words, if you spent $100 on advertising, and it brought in one sale of $200, your ACoS would be 50%.Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)Monitoring your ROAS has several benefits, especially for understanding the efficiency of your campaigns. Whenever a company engages in new marketing efforts, a crucial question is whether that investment is worth it.Â Marketing dollars are worth it when they drive additional revenue, which is precisely what this metric determines. What is the value of your marketing dollars, and specifically your ad spend dollars?How to Manually Calculate ROASROAS is the inverse of the ACoS metric: if you have a ROAS of 6, that means that for every dollar you spent on ads, you collected $6 in revenue.Â SalesThe sales report shows the number of product sales generated within a week of ad clicks.Â A good Amazon Ads dashboard allows you to track sales across different regions, demographics of your buyers, and more.

They help businesses promote their products and increase visibility among potential customers by displaying targeted ads in search results and on product detail pages. Sponsored Ads help sellers and vendors drive more sales by reaching shoppers who are actively searching for products similar to theirs.What Are Amazon Advertising Reports?Amazon Advertising Reports are detailed data and analytics reports provided by Amazon to help sellers and vendors understand the performance of their advertising campaigns. These reports offer insights and metrics that help advertisers optimize their marketing efforts, make data-driven decisions, and ultimately increase the return on investment (ROI) for their advertising budget.What Are the Different Types of Amazon Sponsored AdsThere are three primary types of Amazon Sponsored Ads:Sponsored Products: These ads promote individual product listings and appear in search results or on product detail pages. They're targeted based on keywords that the advertiser selects, and they're designed to help increase product visibility and sales.Sponsored Brands: These ads showcase a brand logo, a custom headline, and a selection of products from the brand's catalog. They appear in prominent locations within search results, such as the top or middle of the page. Sponsored Brands ads are designed to help businesses increase brand awareness and drive sales for multiple products.Sponsored Display: These ads are display ads that can appear on Amazon's website, its mobile app, and third-party sites within Amazon's advertising network.

For example, a recent study showed that influencer campaigns have 11X the ROI of display ads.Â However, influencer campaigns quickly form a tangled web of dull performance metrics that is hard to comprehend on your own. Large brands collaborate with hundreds of influencers across different platforms and regions, and often without a single source of truth for performance tracking.With metrics scattered across different spreadsheets and influencer hubs, it's difficult to determine whether your strategy is driving the desired results or not. An influencer marketing dashboard serves as a command center for all influencer-related activities providing a comprehensive view of your campaigns' performance.In this article, we'll explore how to build an influencer marketing dashboard, what metrics to track, and how to use gathered data to make better marketing decisions. If you're a marketing manager looking to optimize your influencer marketing strategy, keep reading to learn how an influencer marketing dashboard can help you measure the impact of your influencer campaigns and improve your overall marketing performance.If you want to save your team 35â40% of their time, and generate trustworthy influencer marketing reports, Improvado is a solution youâre looking for. Book a consultation with an Improvado expert to see what it can do for your agency.Who Should Use an Influencer Marketing Dashboard?Marketers use influencer marketing dashboards to measure the campaign performance across different platformsFirst, we need to determine the roles across the organization that can benefit from an influencer marketing dashboard. Normally, all revenue team members should check the influencer marketing dashboard once in a while if influencer marketing is the companyâs primary demand generation channel.Â Marketing ManagersMarketing managers should be checking the influencer dashboard on a daily basis. They are responsible for the strategy, messaging, and values conveyed by influencers. Hence, dashboard metrics show whether their campaigns focus on the right audience and how effective their messaging is. Comparing performance with industry benchmarks allows to spot improvement opportunities and tweak campaigns accordingly.Â Hereâs our social media engagement rate forecast for 2023. Learn how your campaigns compare to platformsâ averages.Influencer Partnership ManagersInfluencer partnership managers are responsible for building and maintaining relationships with influencers. They can use an influencer dashboard to track the performance of each influencer, evaluate their impact on the companyâs bottom line, and determine whether they are meeting their contractual obligations.Performance MarketersUnlike most influencer campaigns that focus on building brand awareness, influencer performance marketers prioritize client acquisition. 71% of marketers agree that the quality of customers and traffic from influencer marketing is better than other sources, like email or social media campaigns. Just like with regular display advertising, performance marketers provide influencers with trackers and creatives they place on their public pages and integrate into their content.The influencer marketing dashboard displays data captured by those trackers to help performance marketers identify individual influencers, creatives, and messages that generate more clients and result in lower customer acquisition costs.Sales TeamsSales and marketing alignment can bring invaluable benefits to businesses, and influencer marketing provides a targeted and affordable alternative to expensive advertising campaigns. For instance, 2 Degrees Food, a San Francisco-based food company, uses influencer marketing to leverage peer-to-peer and word of mouth advertising as part of their growth strategy, instead of investing in costly TV commercials.In case influencer marketing is your main source of acquisition, incorporating UTM tags or other trackers into your influencer marketing dashboard is crucial to let your salespeople know the prospects' intent.Letâs say, your company offers two different products and launches two separate influencer campaigns to promote them. Storing the name of your product in the âutm_campaignâ parameter provides your sales team with more context into the prospectsâ intent and needs. In this way, salespeople can structure their presentation according to the product the prospect is interested in to target their pains more effectively.CMOs and Marketing ExecutivesCMOs and other marketing executives can use an influencer dashboard to evaluate the impact of influencer marketing on revenue generation and understand how it compares to other marketing activities.Â Keeping an eye on ROI, engagement, and brand awareness metrics allows them to determine whether their influencer marketing campaigns drive the desired results.Why Use an Influencer Marketing Dashboard?According to Influencer Marketing Hub, 67% of respondents intend to increase their influencer marketing spend in 2023. Given this trend, it's even more important for marketing teams to use an influencer marketing dashboard. Here are some of the key reasons why:Transparent and controllable visibilityAn influencer marketing dashboard provides real-time visibility into the performance of each influencer and the campaign. Marketing teams can track all essential metrics and ROI of campaigns to identify which influencers drive the most significant impact on their business goals. This helps teams optimize their influencer marketing strategy and achieve better results.AccountabilityWith an influencer marketing dashboard companies can switch from quantitive to qualitative approach to influencer marketing. Instead of emphasizing the number of new and ongoing campaigns marketers arm themselves with required data to identify the most effective influencers, platforms, audiences, and more.Â The dashboard also helps teams to hold influencers accountable for underdelivering the expected results that are often stated in the agreement. For example, if the influencer intentionally misinformed you about their average performance metrics and you didnât get the projected number of impressions or clicks, you can easily spot the issue and negotiate for new campaigns to make up for whatâs been stated in the agreement.Continuous growthSometimes, campaigns donât drive the expected results, and itâs not the influencers' fault. Ill-fitting messaging, mistakes during audience research, or poorly designed banners may also result in underperforming campaigns and low ROI.However, an influencer marketing dashboard can help you overcome these issues by showing which of your campaigns perform better. With detailed stats into all campaigns available from one place you can analyze the compound results of all your campaigns as well as dig deeper into each of them to better understand why they overdeliver or underperform.These insights offer significant opportunities to optimize your campaigns and messages delivered to your audience.Get an all-in-one dashboard from the Improvado teamShare some details about your case and set a date to discuss it with an Improvado product expert.

Here are the top metrics to include in your influencer marketing dashboard:ReachReach is the total number of unique people who have seen an influencer's content. It's an essential metric to track because it measures the size of the audience that an influencer can reach.How to calculate Reach manually:To calculate Reach manually, you need to use the formula:Reach = (Impressions / Frequency)Where Impressions are the total number of times an influencer's content has been displayed, and Frequency is the average number of times each person has seen the content. Or, if we put it in math formula, it looks like this:Frequency = Impressions / Unique UsersWhy Reach is important:Reach helps businesses evaluate the campaignâs potential impact. The higher the Reach, the more people an influencer can potentially reach and the greater the potential impact on brand awareness, traffic, and sales.Engagement rateTop influencer videos by views and engagementEngagement rate is the percentage of likes, comments, shares, and other interactions that the influencerâs content generate. It measures how well the audience engages with the content.Â How to calculate engagement manuallyTo calculate engagement manually, you need to use the formula:Engagement = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Other Interactions) / ReachLikes, Comments, Shares, and Other Interactions are the total number of interactions an influencer's content has generated, and Reach is the number of unique people who have seen the content.Why Engagement Rate is importantEngagement is an important metric to track because it measures how well the audience engages with an influencer's content. The higher the Engagement, the more likely the audience is to take action, such as visiting a website or purchasing.Usually, content with low engagement rate brings lower business results. Or, it can even signal that the influencerâs subscribers arenât real people. Collaborating with such influencers may result in campaigns having high number of impressions but low conversion rates or not influencing the companyâs bottom line.Click-Through Rate (CTR)CTR is the percentage of people clicking a link in an influencer's content. It measures how effectively an influencer's content drives traffic to your website, social media, etc.How to calculate CTR manuallyTo calculate CTR manually, you need to use the formula:CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) x 100Clicks are the total number of clicks on the link in an influencer's content, and Impressions are the total number of times the content has been displayed.âWhy CTR is importantCTR is an important metric to track because it measures how effective an influencer's content is at driving traffic to your target destination. The higher the CTR, the more effective the content is at driving traffic and generating leads. Besides, it also indicates that the message youâre conveying is resonating with viewers. Meaning, you can reuse the same approach in other campaigns to achieve higher results.Conversion RateConversion rate is the percentage of people who complete a desired action after clicking on a link in an influencer's content. It measures how effective an influencer's content is at generating leads and sales.How to calculate conversion rate manuallyTo calculate the conversion rate manually, you need to use the formula:Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions / Number of Clicks) x 100The number of Conversions is the total number of people who complete the desired action after clicking on the link, and the Number of Clicks is the total number of clicks on the link in an influencer's content.Why Conversion Rate is importantConversion rate is an important metric to track because it measures how effectively an influencer's content generates leads and sales. The higher the conversion rate, the more effective the content drives Revenue and ROI.Remember that itâs crucial to set the right goals for each of your campaigns. For example, Google Analytics calculates the compound conversion rate for all of your goals. However, if your campaign aims for brand awareness it makes more sense to track pageviews and average number of pages viewed per attracted user than count the number of purchases or call reservations.Return on Investment (ROI)ROI measures the financial return generated from an influencer marketing campaign. It calculates the Revenue generated from the campaign compared to the total campaign cost.How to calculate ROI manuallyTo calculate ROI manually, you need to use the formula:ROI = (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Cost x 100Total Revenue is the total Revenue generated from the campaign, and Total Cost is the total Ñost.Why ROI is importantROI is a critical metric to track because it helps businesses evaluate the financial impact of their influencer marketing campaigns. By tracking ROI, businesses can determine whether their campaigns generate a positive return and adjust their strategy accordingly.Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)CPA is the Cost of acquiring a new customer through an influencer marketing campaign. It measures the cost-effectiveness of the campaign in generating leads and sales.How to calculate CPA manuallyTo calculate CPA manually, you need to use the formula:CPA = Total Cost / Number of ConversionsTotal Cost is the total cost of the campaign, and Number of Conversions is the total number of people who complete the desired action after clicking the link.Why CPA is importantCPA is crucial to understand how cost-efficient your influencer campaigns are. By setting a CPA benchmark you can identify the campaigns that need optimization (actual CPA > benchmark CPA). Keeping your CPA as low as possible is vital to your budget and allows you make space for other campaigns and experiments to launch. Plus, the lower CPA you have the higher ROI of your marketing campaigns is.Brand MentionsBrand mentions are the number of times your brand gets mentioned in discussions on social media and other platforms. This metric helps you measure the recognizability of your brand and understand how prospects perceive your brand or product.How to calculate Brand MentionsTo calculate brand mentions manually, you need to use social media listening tools that can track and measure the mentions of your brand on different platforms. By using these tools you can not only track the number of mentions, but also dive into different discussions and answer prospectsâ questions to build more brand credibility.Â Why Brand Mentions are importantAttributing each brand mention to a particular influencer campaign is tricky (if not impossible), because you canât exactly identify which influencerâs post or video triggered the discussion.Still, sudden spikes of mentions after campaign launches show that the content gave rise to different discussions, which are common after your audience finds out about the product from their content creator. Now, itâs on you to monitor the quality of these discussions. If a user comments on strengths of your product, donât hesitate to respond with a thank you message.Â On the other hand, if some users comment on any negative experiences they had with your product let them know that youâre working on improvements and invite them to give your product another try.As for brand mentions tracking, Improvado allows users to display all the comments from any social media platforms in a single, convenient dashboard. You can filter comments by subject or specific words to figure out the audienceâs attitude to your brand and act accordingly.Total RevenueTotal Revenue is the total revenue generated from an influencer marketing campaign. It measures the financial impact of the campaign on the business.How to calculate Total RevenueTo calculate total revenue, you need to use your CRM system to track and measure the revenue generated from the influencer marketing campaign.Why Total Revenue is importantTotal Revenue metric is the backbone of marketing analytics. It allows you to measure the financial impact of each campaign on the business. Businesses make the majority of marketing decisions based on the generated revenue, so, this metric should never slip out of your attention.How to Build an Influencer Marketing DashboardMeasure the impact of each influencer on the companyâs bottom lineNow, when you have all the data you need to display on the dashboard, weâll discuss the actual ways to display it. Since dashboard is a collective term for different means of displaying your data, there are several ways to build one. Letâs review three most tried and tested ways to gather your influencer metrics in one place:Use built-in dashboards provided by influencer marketing platformsMost influencer marketing platforms have built-in dashboards that allow users to track the performance of their campaigns. While these dashboards provide some level of insight, they are limited in their capabilities.Users can track the performance of their campaigns via platforms they use to find influencers. However, that quickly turns from a single source of truth to questioning âWhere my metrics at?â if you use multiple platforms to collaborate with influencers. Platforms donât integrate with each other, so youâll have to jump around all of them to get a holistic view of your performance.And whatâs more, you canât see the entire impact of your cross-channel efforts. Letâs say, a prospect has landed on your website from an influencer campaign, but didnât make a purchase. Then, they found your companyâs social media account, went to your website again, and finally made the purchase. Built-in dashboards would say that the visit didnât result in a conversion. But with a cross-channel view you can say for sure that this prospect has had their first touch with your brand via the influencer campaign and it resulted in a conversion.A built-in dashboard is a good option for starters that work with one or two influencers within the same platform. But, scaling becomes a nightmare in the long run, and youâll most likely end up gathering all performance metrics manually when youâll employ influencer directly or via another platform.Build a Spreadsheet-Based DashboardMoving on, spreadsheet software is a viable option for those who need a quick way to gather influencer data in one place and visualize it.Â To build such a dashboard, you can use tools Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. You can create custom charts and graphs to visualize your data and use formulas to calculate metrics such as reach, engagement rate, CTR, and conversion rate.Spreadsheets are a cost-effective way to jumpstart your analytics without significant investment or engineering/analytics expertise. Simply copy data provided by influencers into a spreadsheet and create the required charts.The problem with spreadsheets is that youâre signing up for never-ending crunching of numbers, formulas, and metrics in this spreadsheet. The thing is, spreadsheets are all about manual operations. Manual data collection, cleaning, storing, organizing, etc. Itâs not a big deal if you have only a few campaigns launched. But the things change when youâre dealing with hundreds of them.Â By the time you fill up the spreadsheet, your data becomes obsolete. Donât forget to count in the human factor. Even a single mistake can render your dashboard useless. So, you need to have some data verification process in place to be sure of its quality.Of course, some platforms provide API integrations that can connect directly to your spreadsheet and pour it with data automatically. However, you still need to get rid of duplicates and cleanse your data manually. Plus, APIs require technical expertise, knowledge of the documentation, and regular maintenance.Â Wrapping up, spreadsheets are worth giving a try. If youâre tracking a couple of campaigns and donât have loads of data to collect â go for spreadsheets. However, if youâre all about effective cross-channel marketing analytics and searching for a single source of truth for metrics across hundreds of campaigns, you should take a look at the next option.Automate your entire marketing analytics with ImprovadoInfluencer dashboard development is a tricky and tiring task to handle.

Manual reporting efforts can also lead to errors and a lack of accuracy, significantly influencing the quality and speed of decision-making. Automated reporting is the way forward.Marketing reporting software is designed to help businesses and marketing teams track, analyze, and report on their marketing campaigns and initiatives. The software collects data from various marketing channels and provides insights into how well campaigns are performing, which tactics are working, and where improvements can be made.Marketing reporting tools typically include dashboard reporting, analytics, data visualization, and automation capabilities.

Even if the software claims it can handle everything, chances are there will be one or two holes in the feature set. Every marketing team is different, and whatâs âall-in-oneâ to you may not be to someone else.Â Still, there are a few features every marketing team should look for in a reporting tool.1. AutomationA marketing reporting tool lacking automation isnât worth your time. A huge benefit to investing in this type of software is the ability to streamline your workflow and increase productivity. Automation is the way forward, which makes it a critical element in your marketing reporting software.Â 2. CustomizationÂ Thereâs no one-size-fits-all model for marketing reporting tools, so your chosen software needs to allow for customization. Determining which metrics are most vital to your organization and which you want to display for your clients is a critical part of the process.Your marketing channel focus is another crucial factor. If you work with Facebook and LinkedIn more than web content, you likely need to prioritize social media on your dashboard. In this case, you need a flexible dashboard and capable reporting software.Â All businesses must have the scalability conversation at some point. Automated reporting tools allow you to grow more quickly and easily.Â 3. VisualizationÂ While this might be optional for certain companies and isnât included in every marketing reporting software, visualization can be critical. A key benefit of investment in reporting and analytics tools is the ability to showcase your data in a digestible format.For most marketing teams, a robust data visualization option is non-negotiable. Look for software that displays your data in a way that feels intuitive to your workflow to make integration seamless.Transform Your Data into Actionable Insights with ImprovadoWhen you must develop, evaluate, and execute comprehensive marketing strategies, you deal with large volumes of data.

And it's only growing. In terms of engagement rate Instagram confidently holds second place after Tiktok. Even though Instagram's 0,6% is well away from TikTok's whopping 4,25%, it's still miles better than Facebook's 0,15% and Twitter's 0,05%.Â For anyone wondering if Instagram is still relevant to their business, consider that it's still the most downloaded app in the world (followed by TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp, respectively).Â However, advertising on Instagram without analyzing your marketing efforts may quickly drain your marketing budget. In this guide, we discuss how to build a comprehensive Instagram analytics dashboard, what metrics to include, and how to get the most out of Instagram data.Â Key TakeawaysSocial media analytics is crucial to a successful marketing strategy.Instagram is a relevant platform for numerous industries and is still growing.Using an Instagram dashboard is an effective way to visualize your data.Third-party dashboard tools are more efficient than Instagramâs in-app offering in almost every scenario.Some of the most important metrics to track on Instagram are engagement rates, impressions, follower growth, and top-performing posts.Three best practices for building an Instagram dashboard include combining data to see the big picture, automating the process where possible, and using data to visualize and tell a story.Marketing analytics platforms can streamline your Instagram analytics experience and provide actionable insights.Â Why Instagram Analytics MatterWhich one of your recent posts got the most engagement in the past two weeks? How about last month? Which hashtags are the most valuable for your audience? Which ones are you using most frequently? These are important questions that require answers if you want to achieve more with your marketing campaigns, creatives, or messaging. Tracking your Instagram metrics will help you find those answers.Â Consider the following allegory. When youâre sick, you go to the doctor. A healthcare professional runs various tests and analyzes your symptoms. With all the data, they can find out whatâs malfunctioning inside your body. Then, doctors and nurses pull all the reports and charts together to understand the full scope of your condition.Â Monitoring Instagram engagement metrics is about the same thing. With all the data about your Instagram efforts, you can diagnose what isnât workingâand adjust your strategy accordingly.Â A insights-driven strategy considers all past mistakes and failures. This guarantees more cost-efficient and scalable campaigns.Why You Should Use an Instagram DashboardWhen you think about analytics for Instagram, you likely envision long, grueling spreadsheets and enormous piles of data. However, it doesnât have to be this way. Manual reporting and building charts in spreadsheets is only good if you need to test something or find a quick answer to your question. However, using this approach in your day-to-day activities always results in wasted time and untrustworthy data. And - why so?Copypasting Instagram metrics to your spreadsheet will eventually result in mistakes. You either accept this fact or spend more time double checking your data. Now, imaging running hundreds of campaigns, collecting all that data, and gazing at each data cell afterwards to find a mistake. It easily away the better part of the week if you want to have data worth working with.On the other hand you have an Instagram analytics dashboard. With its help you can represent your data in any way you want in a convenient interface of popular BI tools. From simple line charts to mosaic and scatter plots, you can show your data any way you want.Â If Instagram is your main acquisition source, your business could benefit from a dedicated Instagram analytics dashboard for better transparency, visibility, and accountability for marketing activities.Jumpstart your Instagram analytics with ImprovadoBook a callThe Basics of Instagram AnalyticsÂ There are two ways to monitor your Instagram analytics and visualize your data:Use a third-party dashboard builderÂ Use Instagramâs in-app analytics platform.Â Both carry pros and cons, so letâs start with an overview of the in-app offering.Â In-App AnalyticsInstagramâs in-app analytics is a useful resource for marketing professionals, but it comes with a decent number of limitations. The built-in reporting tool provides basic insights into your account performance, which can be useful when checking on a data point youâre already familiar with.Â Instagramâs platform can offer fundamental insights into performance metrics such as:ReachFollowersEngagementAdvertising resultsPost-specific dataAnd moreSo, if Instagram already provides professional accounts with in-app analytics (and even a dashboard overview), why consider a third-party tool?Thereâs actually more than just one reason.Third-Party ToolsA third-party analytics tool is essential for marketing professionals who need more than a basic glance at simple metrics.Â You can find robust, feature-rich platforms that allow you to create beautiful-yet-understandable dashboards featuring advanced performance metrics. While in-app analytics provides just the basic performance metrics, such as reach, clicks, and engaged accounts, third-party tools allow you to calculate metrics more valuable to your business, such as CAC, cost per engaged account, revenue generated by paid and organic posts, and more.Â You also get much better visualization capabilities compared to Instagramâs basic in-app charts. Since Instagram is optimized for mobile, the appâs provided analytics are also mobile-oriented. This can be a significant limiting factor, making reporting challenging or even completely inaccessible. Using a robust third-party dashboard means you can dive deeper into your reports on your desktop or laptop as well, expanding the scope of your analytical efforts.Â But the true killer feature of third-party analytics tools is that they allow to merge Instagram data with performance metrics from other channels on a single dashboard. And that means you can understand how your Instgram campaigns compare to other channels and what practices from other platforms you can implement to improve your Instagram account performance.Besides, a comprehensive dashboard may help you capture trends faster and make informed decisions about your overall marketing strategy.Take a look at Improvadoâs organic social dashboard that allows you to explore posts, reach, views, engagement rates, and clicks across all your social channels. Having both quick overview of your channels and detailed breakdown of each campaignâs performance improves decision-making and facilitates campaign optimization.Â Â Now, itâs time to understand which metrics are key for the platform and how to track them on your dashboard.Instagram Metrics to Include In the DashboardAs with any marketing channel, your data is only as good as the metrics youâre tracking. Thatâs why itâs essential to grasp which metrics matter most to the individual platform or a group of platforms youâre visualizing on a dashboard. Social media comes with different factors when compared to web content, though each platform has its own KPIs.On Instagram, youâre concerned with the amount of engagement you receive, just like on other social media platforms. However, there is an increased focus on follower growth. Itâs one of the most important metrics to monitor.Â Below, youâll find some of the most important metrics to track when building your analytics platform:Â Engagement RateSocial media marketing is about one thing above all othersâengagement. Though you can pop into your audience's inbox with email marketing and develop valuable resources on your website, no marketing channel facilitates direct engagement quite like social media.Â Instagram is no exception, which is why itâs vital to track your engagement rate.Think of engagement rate tracking as keeping a pulse on your Instagram marketing efforts. This metric acts as a lifeline, letting you know how things are truly doing. Your engagement rate is the percentage of your following that regularly interacts with your content, considering the number of likes and comments you receive on a post in relation to your overall follower count.ImpressionsIf youâve ever dabbled in analytics, youâre likely already familiar with this metric. Impressions on Instagram work largely in the same way they do on the web. This metric is tracking the number of people who have been exposed to your account.Â You can filter that data by a specified period if you want to understand how a certain campaign has impacted your impressions.Follower GrowthFollower tracking on Instagram is similarly crucial. Unlike simply tracking the number of likes youâre getting on a post, your follower growth is not a vanity metric. You arenât just keeping tabs on your existing follower countâyouâre actively monitoring the growth rate of your following.Gaining a large number of followers quickly doesnât always equate to actual conversions, but that doesnât mean your following shouldnât grow steadily if your campaigns are effective. Tracking your follower growth is important to see whether youâre trending upward or downward.Â Top Performing PostsAnother common social media metric that remains applicable and valuable for Instagram is your top-performing posts. When your team begins crafting the next campaign, knowing what has worked best in the past is helpful. This can assist you in understanding what your audience is drawn to and how to reach them in future campaigns.3 Best Practices For Building An Instagram DashboardWhen building your ideal Instagram analytics dashboard, you must ensure youâre creating the most valuable central hub you can. To do that, follow these best practices for building an Instagram data hub.Â Combine Data to See the Big PictureUsing a dashboard can be incredibly beneficial in allowing teams to see the big picture. With in-app analytics your marketing vision is limited to a single channel. But a dashboard lets you combine your data and KPIs into a single source of truth to get a birdâs-eye-view. So, combining your data is crucial to make unbiased decisions and optimize your cross-channel marketing effort.Â Automate When PossibleAutomation is critical in any analytics-tracking venture. Donât waste your time with DIY solutions with manual data collectionâopt for a solution that automatically sources data from Instagram and generates actionable insights based on said information.Improvado is just what it takes to create an actionable analytics dashboard. The platform integrates with 500+ marketing and sales data sources to pull required metrics, turn it into a digestible form, and streamline to a visualization tool of your choice.Â Instead of wasting time drawing identical pie and bar charts in spreadsheets you get access to a library of customizable dashboard templates for social media, paid ads, web analytics, and other use cases. Improvadoâs templates allow you to start analyzing in days, not weeks or even months.Jumpstart your marketing analytics with ImprovadoImprovado integrates with 500+ data sources to build a comprehensive dashboard for you.

Find the story in the numbers, then convey that story on your dashboard for best results.Use a Marketing Analytics Platform to Squeeze the Most out of Instagram DataFocusing on social media performance is crucial to understanding marketingâs team impact on the organizationâs bottom line. However, you need clear-cut data to design your perfect Instagram analytics dashboard thatâll fuel your decision-making.

In other words, they are success metrics calculated based on data from different sources.Â KPI dashboards show progress on KPIs in a visual, easily digestible format to help inform business decisions. Real-time dashboards automate any manual data wrangling processes, allowing teams to focus on uncovering insights into their goal progress.Â KPI dashboards are a necessary foundation for teams and companies that want to join the data-driven side. However, ensuring you use good-quality data to avoid false insights is vital.What Do KPI Dashboards Include?A KPI dashboard includes all the relevant data end users need to make data-driven decisions for ultimate goal achievement and to adjust their strategy on the go.The included metrics depend on the dashboardâs audience. Whatâs their goal? What question do they want to have answered? Which KPIs are important for the audience to gauge performance? What data can best help them get actionable business insights?Once youâve determined these variables, choose all the relevant data you need to include in the dashboard. Use various visualization techniques, such as trend analysis over time and comparatives and benchmarks, to provide more context.Also, add annotations to the visuals to help describe the data to the end user.Key Business Benefits of KPI DashboardsData is only useful when you can make sense of it. However, making sense of it gets increasingly complicated with the growing amount of data you collect. Thatâs what KPI dashboards help you with. Letâs review how exactly this is achieved.Facilitates effective executive decision-makingWith a KPI dashboard, executives donât have to wait for different departments to report on their activities and performance. All of this information is stored in a single source of truth for the companyâs KPIs.Executives have a real-time view of each teamâs performance and contribution to the organizationâs bottom line. This means they can see which units and processes to focus on to achieve business goals faster.Improves operational efficiency and effectivenessKPI dashboards streamline organizational workflow, making it easy for employees to work efficiently.Letâs say the marketing team needs data on the lead-to-customer conversion rate from the sales team or the customer satisfaction index score from the customer support team. In these cases, they can get this info from the KPI dashboard without waiting for someone to hand them the data, stopping the time-consuming back and forth between different parties.Increases collaboration and transparency between teamsWith a shared KPI dashboard of real-time data, teams can easily make decisions without waiting for another personâs input.This democratizes data, fostering collaboration and accelerating communication, ultimately leading to better team alignment and happier employees.Facilitates real-time data analysis at scaleThe real-time delivery of KPI dashboards gives executives insights into business operations as they happen.Using a dashboard's interactive elements, they can drill down into each specific KPI without going through many spreadsheets or wading through different programs.Provides valuable data for predicting business growthKPIs tell you how you're progressing toward a goal. With a KPI dashboard, you have a tool that helps you assess the direction your business is heading.You can better see patterns and forecast business growthâand with that, decide the next steps that will allow you to reach your business objectives efficiently.Provides insights on what to prioritizeData overwhelm is a huge problem for many decision-makers. Having dashboards on relevant KPIsâfueled by good-quality dataâ means you can better analyze business operations without being overwhelmed.Since dashboards properly organize and visualize critical information, you can quickly identify what to focus on and prioritize.Steps for Creating KPI DashboardsDeveloping a KPI dashboard is an intricate and time-consuming activity. But, not for those who know the right steps and use the right tools to visualize KPIs.Â Choose the KPIs and metrics to trackWhat questions do end-users want to have answered and what information do they need? Consider this when creating a KPI dashboard, so you don't end up featuring vanity metrics.Focus only on the most crucial metrics for the monitored activity. For example, if youâre building a sales pipeline dashboard, you definitely donât need to include CLTV or CPA, because salespeople have almost nothing to do with these metrics.Â Most KPI dashboards use the MAD frameworkâa three-level approach to creating dashboards. It includes the monitor level for high-level KPIs like annual recurring revenue or relative market share, the analysis level for analyzing KPIs across various departments, and the drill level for detailed KPIs for deep-dive analysis.Select relevant data sourcesEvaluate all your available data sources and decide which ones are relevant. This isn't always straightforward, especially with the many tools businesses use nowadays.Choose data sources wisely because each new one comes with engineering and maintenance hassles. Youâll have to connect each source to your dashboarding tool, fetch the right data, transform it into a digestible form, and come up with new charts to visualize it. Not to mention that data sources come with unique APIs which require frequent updates on the back-end.A better option is to connect all required data sources with an automated analytics platform. For example, Improvado integrates with 500+ different marketing and sales data sources to quickly extract data and streamline it to a dashboard tailored to the userâs objectives. With Improvadoâs plug-and-play approach, you can jumpstart your analytics and scale it as you go by adding data sources from the library.Get a KPI dashboard without data hassleSchedule a consultation to discuss your analytics goals with our product expert.

What KPIs do they need to compare and contrast? Building the dashboard with your audience in mind will reveal what information should be included.Use text effectivelyYour data is telling a story. As much as the charts and graphs illustrate that, so does the language you use for labeling and descriptions.Get clear on the insights you want to get across using well-thought-out annotation principles.Clearly label interactive elements and make it obvious that they are clickable or drillable.Aim for visual consistencyHaving a nice-looking KPI dashboard is a key element of effective dashboards. Your ultimate goal is to display data that key people in the organization can quickly get insights into.One way to do this is by sticking to consistent colors and styles and applying visual design principles.Keep it simpleIt's easy to get excited about the various charts and graphs you can make out of all your data, but clutter ruins KPI dashboards. Make them as simple as possible. Overcrowding with irrelevant dataâno matter how interestingâwill only distract from the narrative you're trying to convey.Ensure youâre using clean dataKPI dashboards make data easy to understand. But it's of no use if this data is from poor-quality sources. Before creating a dashboard, ensure that the integrity and accuracy of your data are sound.How to Create a KPI Dashboard with ImprovadoCreating a KPI dashboard is a time suck, although an extremely valuable time suck.

Let alone classic data sources, such as online store analytics systems, Google Analytics, and email marketing software.Â Recently, Shopify rolled out its new âAudiencesâ feature designed to help marketers attribute purchases from different ad accounts (e.g., Facebook Ads). What it basically does, is match the email of the order with the customerâs Facebook email to then identify the most promising audiences for your business. The main issue of Shopifyâs âAudiencesâ is the number of supported data sources. It only allows you to gather audiences across Facebook and Google Ads. Currently, marketers need to keep an eye on way more platforms than Facebook and Google.Thatâs where marketing analytics platforms make a world of difference. Improvado uses an attribution system that can smoothly integrate with any ad platform in Improvadoâs library. With its help, you can connect the dots between marketing, sales, and financial data and identify the most promising audiences across all your ad channels. With 500+ different integrations, there wonât be any platform left that you canât attribute revenue from.Hereâs an example of the attribution dashboard that uses different attribution models to analyze performance across channels by Improvado:

 From gut feelings to clear-cut dashboards.

What Should a Shopify Dashboard Include?Â If you have a look at the best marketing dashboard examples, you will see that they usually contain information such as:the efficiency of marketing campaigns (including those in top retail media networks and social media),sales results,customer behavior,inventory level,operational costs.Selecting the right metrics for your Shopify dashboard strongly depends on your position in the e-commerce company and what your tasks are.Â Data should be presented in the form of charts, tables, and other types of visualization.Â Any Shopify sales dashboard should provide you with the following metrics and KPIs:TrafficÂ Traffic is the number of visits in a chosen period. This way, you can assess whether interest in your online store is growing or if you need to expand your marketing and advertising to increase traffic.Letâs take a look at Improvadoâs cross-channel dashboard. It displays all vital metrics about your marketing performance, enabling you to see the performance of each campaign and channel in a single tab. Besides, you can monitor metrics broken down by gender, age, and geographical regions.For marketers interested solely in web traffic overview, Pradeep Kumar G shared a comprehensive web traffic dashboard. It shows every traffic-related metric, from the total number of sessions to the best-performing referral domains.Bounce rateBounce rate informs you what percentage of all sessions ended up viewing only a single page. To put it simpler, it shows you what part of your visitors wasnât satisfied with your online store, at least as much to go check other pages than the one theyâve landed on. According to Oberlo, the average bounce rate for e-commerce companies reached 47% in Q2 of 2022.Â User BehaviorIt's not exactly a metric but rather a set of different metrics that helps you find the most promising customers and optimize user journeys, listings, and more.Â Hereâs an example of a Shopify dashboard that shows the breakdown of customers by geographical region, types of purchased products, purchase frequency, and more.Â Add to cart rate and abandoned cart rateAdd to cart rate is the percentage of users that added some products to the cart during their visit. The other metric tells you what part of users abandon their carts and leave your e-commerce website without finalizing their transactions.The add-to-cart rate depends heavily on the type of goods youâre selling. Recent statistics from Oberlo show that everyday goods and groceries have a higher add-to-cart rate compared to luxurious items or large goods, such as furniture.Â Â As for cart abandonment, the average rate for the retail industry stands at 72.8%. Yet again, the rate varies depending on the type of product youâre selling. According to Bolt, fashion goods have the highest cart abandonment rate of 40%.A Shopify sales dashboard helps you understand whether your shop is in line with the industryâs benchmarks, why users abandon their carts, and what are the points of improvement.Â Conversion rates and total salesYou should analyze the conversion rate to learn if a proper percentage of visitors take the desired action on your storeâs website. The goal may be signing in to the newsletter database or making a purchase.Â Since buying is a widespread, final-stage conversion, you need to keep an eye on goals higher up the funnel to understand the percentage of users that become actual buyers. How many people that subscribed to your newsletter eventually became customers? Whatâs the percentage of users that made a purchase after a cart abandonment email? A well-designed Shopify dashboard should answer all of these questions.Average order valueAverage order value (AOV) helps sales specialists and marketers to define their next goals, devise a strategy and leverage discounts or recommendation systems. If it is too small, a company can offer additional products for an extra price or grant free delivery for orders above a given value.Â AOV is calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of orders. However, for more detailed visualization, you can calculate the average order value by country or region. Hereâs an example:Â New vs. returning customers and customer lifetime valueIt is essential to know how many of your visitors are new customers who have returned to buy again. You can track your clientsâ behavior and assess their loyalty. To learn if your acquisition campaigns are cost-effective, you can check your customer acquisition cost.Â The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) helps you to measure the profitability of your customers (how much money they are willing to spend during your entire relationship with your business) and allows you to better adjust personalized campaigns.Â Hereâs a formula to help you calculate CLV:Â Average customer lifetime value = (average number of transactions per month) * (average order value) * (average gross margin) * (average customer lifespan) / number of clients for the particular period.Thereâs a vast space for experiments when displaying customer lifetime value. For example, you can find the most profitable customers by breaking down audiences into groups based on different criteria (sales channel, education, location, etc.).Â Online Store SessionsThis metric allows you to learn how much time visitors spend on your website. A session starts when users visit your store and ends when they leave (the session is also considered ended if a visitor doesn't interact with content for 30 minutes). In general, if the session is short, it can mean that the visitor is unsatisfied with the website (because he canât find a particular product or find the website boring or non-intuitive, etc.).Â According to different benchmarks, the median value for average session duration for B2C companies is 92.33 seconds.Online store sessions are considered a tricky metric thought because it is difficult to decide how long the session should last.Â Inventory levelIn business, capital should flow. A high inventory level can mean that your capital is frozen. Information about inventory levels in specific periods, presented on the Shopify dashboard, can be used to adjust the storeâs offer to the marketâs demand.Â Of course, inventory level also helps to manage products by making orders at the right time and in the right amounts.Â Shipping costsOnline store owners should make sure that products are being shipped efficiently. With access to such data in your Shopify dashboard, you can react fast when you realize that you overspend on shipping and delivery.Â There are various ways to handle situations like that â you can negotiate new terms with your partners, increase the cost of delivery or raise the minimal value of the order for your customers.Grow Your Shopify Account with ImprovadoÂ Thanks to Improvado integrations with Shopify and 500+ marketing, sales, and analytics platforms, you can build a Shopify dashboard to serve as a universal command center of your store.

Its data granularity is relatively low, making it difficult for users to go as deep as they want with their marketing data.
Whatagraph mostly integrates with social media platforms and other marketing tools but lacks sales data source connectors, which makes it difficult to map the whole customer journey, from ad click to check amount. 

Global brands tend to go with Improvadoâa solution with advanced features, a large catalog of data source connectors, endless customization options, and capable of processing large volumes of data. Book a consultation with an Improvado expert to see how the solution can streamline your global marketing reporting.

On the other hand, the Premium plan limits you to 50 data sources and allows you to increase this at additional costs.It is also important to note that Whatagraph only has around 40 integrations.

Thus, its mobile attribution solution packs some of its best functionalities. For marketers using only web-based channels, Singular performs attribution using JavaScript tags which track visitors and provide reports on their behavior.In general, Singular doesn't provide extensive historical analytics. And being a mobile-first platform, if your company has a combination of app and web presence, Singular may not be suitable for you from the web side of things.There is also an issue with the granularity of data by Singular as the platform doesnât offer identifiers for server-side sources like email and phone numbers. To manage data sharing with these types of identifiers, youâd need a different data platform.Improvado works with first-party cookies and in the cookieless environment, features a large catalog of data source connectors, and seamlessly processes large volumes of data. These features allow brands to analyze the performance of all their marketing efforts, identify high-impact touchpoints, the most frequently occurring events for a specific audience, and which events trigger the prospect to advance through the awareness ladder.Singular Use CasesSingular is designed specifically for marketing professionals and agencies.

It is a marketing analytics solution powered by advanced features, multiple customization options, and a team with extensive experience in the marketing field, making it a great fit for enterprise and mid-market brands.Social media analytics goes way beyond reach, clicks, and engagement rate. Imagine a quarterly report presented to the C-Suite saying that your team doubled the impressions and gained a 20% growth in followers.Â While these numbers are valuable for the social media team, CFOs and CEOs operate with completely different metrics. They want to see how social media contributes to the revenue growth and whatâs the ROI of your efforts.Â A holistic media dashboard is an effective way to get granular insights for your day-to-day tasks, as well as to provide an overview of all KPIs to stakeholders. A visualized story of your activities during the quarter better explains how those posts, clicks, and engagement impact revenue generation.Â Here, weâre exploring what a social media dashboard is, why itâs crucial for businesses today, and the best practices to know when using third-party solutions. We will also look at real-world examples to help you understand the power of an effective social media analytics dashboard.Get a social media dashboard without all the data hassleBook a call with ImprovadoWhat Is a Social Media Dashboard?A social media dashboard is a type of online marketing dashboard that helps you maximize ROI of your social media campaigns by providing an overview of key metrics and explaining how they drive your company to its goals.Having access to this data allows you to optimize campaigns and:Get a higher return on ad spend (ROAS),Drive conversions,Measure the success of your efforts.Â Benefits include:Â At-a-glance overview of metrics,Tracking performance capability across all channels,Ability to optimize campaigns,Gaining insights into customer behavior,Measuring success easily,Automating processes.Social media dashboards enable you to monitor campaigns on-the-go, reevaluate your marketing strategy, optimize social media ads, and make informed decisions generally.What should be in a social media dashboard?Different metrics serve different goals. While impressions might indicate the growth of brand awareness, direct social purchases on social media influence bottom-funnel conversions. The charts and visualization styles might differ from dashboard to dashboard, but thereâs a set of essential metrics that always need to be present on your social media dashboard.Â Letâs go through all the vital metrics that should be present on your dashboard. But first, take a look at a LinkedIn overview dashboard from Improvado showcasing all vital metrics you need to keep an eye on.ReachReach refers to the total number of unique accounts that have seen your ads. Reach is most often used to get a better understanding of your brand awareness.Â Reach is considered to be a vanity metric that doesnât show the real impact of your social efforts on the companyâs bottom line. However, itâs still important to know how many users have seen your ads, if your business is scaling and aiming for new audiences. Without emphasizing on reach, many of your potential customers would have never heard of your brand, offer, or strong message.Hereâs an example of a social media engagement and reach dashboard showing you how many impressions, clicks, shares, and other metrics were generated by each of your social media posts.Engagement rateEngagement rate is another essential metric for a social media dashboard. It measures the amount of interaction a piece of content gets compared to reach or accountâs followers count.Hereâs a formula to calculate the engagement rate for your social media marketing dashboard:Engagement rate = Total Engagement / Total Followers (Reach) * 100%Total Engagement is the sum of all interactions you consider to be an engagement (likes, share, comments, etc.)Total followers is the number of users who follow your social media account. Total followers is often changed to total reach, which is the total number of impressions generated by a particular post.If youâre feeling a bit lazy to calculate it yourself, Hootsuite offers a free social media engagement rate calculator.When it comes to displaying engagement rate on a social media dashboard, the visualization can be as simple as a regular line chart.Â Alternatively, you can get more creative and come up with a scatter plot like this. It shows the correlation between each postâs engagement rate and reach.Follower growth rateFollower growth rate measures the speed at which your social media account is growing its audience. It is an invaluable indicator of your campaignsâ health. Plus, it helps you understand how do you keep up against your competitors and assess the projected share of voice for your brand on social media.Â Use this formula to calculate your follower growth rate:Number of new followers / Total number of followers * 100Social media monitoring dashboards usually have follower growth rates depicted in a form of a line chart. With a chart like this itâs easy to spot peaks and troughs within a given timeline.Engagement metrics per postThis category includes all most common social media metrics such as likes, shares, replies, comments, etc. These metrics are a barometer of how your posts resonate with your audience. An engagement overview social dashboard is a go-to tool for marketers when analyzing their previous campaigns, optimizing them, and planning on new ones.C-level metricsFrankly, most executives donât dive deep into reach or follower growth rates. They often donât have time to figure out how these metrics influence actual company performance. Thatâs why you need a dashboard that speaks the same language as executives do. The language of revenue.Executive dashboards are often tailored to each executive, so they can draw up quick conclusions in their areas of expertise. Some of the metrics are share of voice, earned media value, cost per acquisition, competitor analysis data, and more.Why Build a Social Media Dashboard?There are multiple reasons you want to use a social media dashboard. Most notably, a dashboard offers transparency, insights to optimize strategy, real-time data, and automated reporting, making analysis simple, quick, and effective.Â Ensure quick access to performance insightsÂ Â Social media dashboards offer the visibility needed to track performance across all social media campaigns. With an effective dashboard, you can monitor campaigns in real time, identify trends quickly, and make informed decisions that help you optimize your strategies and course correct when needed. In addition, this level of insight helps you stay ahead of the competition by ensuring you take advantage of every opportunity available.Real-time streamlined data collectionDashboards also streamline data collection from multiple sources into one central location. By aggregating data from all of your social channels, you gain valuable insight about customer behavior without having to manually search through each platform individually. In turn, you can better understand how customers interact with your brand online and tailor your marketing plan accordingly.Automated reporting & analysisFinally, the best social media dashboard will offer automated reporting and analysis capabilities, enabling you to save time when analyzing large amounts of data.Â For example, some dashboards have built-in analytics tools so that you can generate reports based on specific metrics like engagement rate or click-through rate (CTR) over a certain period of time. This means you can measure success more accurately than ever before. Additionally, many dashboards are equipped with AI algorithms that detect patterns in user behavior so you can spot potential opportunities fast and act even faster.Best Practices for Successful Social Media Dashboard DesignSocial media dashboard tools are essential in todayâs online marketing efforts. To get the most out of your dashboard, there are certain best practices to keep in mind.Centralize data from all social media channelsTo get a comprehensive social media dashboard you have to gather the required data first. Thatâs a complex process which requires your marketing team to:Define the list of social media platformsSet up API connections for every platformSet up a data storage capable of processing large amounts of dataLoad data into a centralized storage for further transformationsThis is where marketing teams often face challenges. Since this step requires programming and database management know-how, non-technical marketers often canât handle the task by themselves. As a result, they either stop building the dashboard or try to gather data manually, which becomes outdated by the time they finish gathering it.Let Improvado streamline your marketing dataImprovado integrates with 500+ data sources to help you build a comprehensive dashboard. On a 30-min call, you can tell us more about your social media objectives to get a dashboard tailored to your needs.Schedule a callEnsure high data granularityIt is essential to have the ability to get as granular as possible when creating a social media dashboard. Gaining deeper insights into the performance of each channel is the number one goal, so the more data you can access the more effective your dashboard will be.Â Â Granular performance metrics across all platforms allow you to better tailor content and campaigns to maximize social media marketing impact.Some social media dashboards allow you to dig deeper into different granularity levels.

This means you canât simply stitch data from different APIs into a single storage or spreadsheet without additional data manipulations.Â These manipulations include:Data deduplicationCross-channel data mappingAlignment of naming conventionsJoining and unioning data tables with SQLYet again, non-technical marketers canât execute these processes properly and often push faulty data right to the dashboard. It results in blind spots in marketing analytics and leads to poor decisions.Use automated alerts & reportsAutomated alerts & reports provide real-time updates on key metrics such as:ImpressionsClicksConversionsEtc.Â Armed with this information, it is easier to stay ahead of any changes in campaign performance without having to constantly monitor each platform manually every day.Â Be sure to set thresholds within the system, so you can receive notifications when certain metrics exceed or fall below identified levels.

It provides a centralized platform to track and analyze various metrics, such as website traffic, engagement, leads, and conversions, which can help marketing teams optimize their marketing strategies and improve content performance.The primary role of a content marketing dashboard is to help teams monitor the performance of organic channels. By tracking key metrics, teams can evaluate their efforts' effectiveness and adjust their strategies accordingly to achieve better results.Content marketing dashboards usually provide a real-time view of metrics, allowing teams to make content tweaks, redesign distribution strategies, check keyword positions, etc. They can also help teams set specific goals and track progress against those goals.Â In a nutshell, a content marketing dashboard eliminates the need to switch between different analytics tools and platforms. By having all the relevant information in one place, teams can streamline data analysis and reporting, saving time and resources.Find this and 11 other marketing dashboards in our comprehensive list of ready-to-use marketing dashboards and templates.Who Should Use a Content Marketing Dashboard?Content marketing dashboards are versatile enough to not only help regular content marketers, but also fulfill the needs of C-level marketing executives. Let's look at how different organizational roles can use it to improve their content marketing campaigns.Content Marketing ManagersContent marketing managers can use the content marketing dashboard to understand how their day-to-day activities convert into numbers. By tracking content performance metrics, such as page views, average time on page, bounce rate, etc., they can assess whether the content is engaging enough and make necessary adjustments if required.Â Additionally, the dashboard tracks the goals set for content pieces, such as trial requests, resource downloads, email form completion, etc. These goals show which content pieces drive your department to different objectives and which pieces should be optimized.C-level Marketing ExecutivesC-level marketing executives use content marketing dashboards to evaluate the effectiveness of their content marketing strategy and the ROI of content marketing campaigns to make data-driven decisions. With this information, they can align the content departmentâs activities with global business goals and optimize content budgets.Â Whatâs more, data from content marketing dashboards is an integral part of the quarterly/annual marketing report which CMOs present to the board. If the report proves that the organic channel generates enough revenue, the CFO might allocate more resources to scale successful content marketing activities.Finally, the dashboard also might show the share of voice owned by your company compared to competitors. This info might be useful to better understand the reach of your content and the global share of the market occupied by your organization in the niche market.Performance Marketing ManagersPerformance marketing managers closely cooperate with content marketers. For example, teams often distribute promising content pieces via paid search ads and social media ads. Performance marketers can use the content marketing dashboard to assess the quality of incoming paid traffic and decide whether itâs worth investing in paid ads to promote the content piece.Another point of intersection between performance and content teams is the messaging used on paid creatives. Performance marketers monitor different campaigns to understand which images or narrative works best. Having a separate dashboard that tracks the performance of different creatives helps performance marketers identify the most promising messaging and adjust other campaigns according to this messaging. Hereâs, for example, how it works with Improvadoâs paid ads dashboard:Why Use a Content Marketing Dashboard?Content marketing dashboards are essential for marketing teams as they provide a centralized platform to track and analyze metrics related to their content marketing efforts. Here are some benefits of using a content marketing dashboard:Increased visibilityContent marketing dashboards offer a comprehensive view of marketing performance, providing real-time insights into data, including pageviews, clicks, social media engagement, leads, and conversions. This increased visibility can help teams identify trends, discover opportunities, and optimize their strategies in real time.Improved accountabilityA clear record of goals in a content marketing dashboard makes teams more accountable for their activities. More accountability motivates teams to achieve their targets and sets a clear course for a team, which makes it more productive.Better decision-makingContent marketing dashboards enable teams to make informed decisions by providing access to real-time data. With a clear understanding of what's working and what's not, teams can optimize their content, improve overall messaging, and make accurate strategic decisions.CustomizationA content marketing dashboard can be customized to fit a team's specific needs. Teams can choose the metrics they want to track, the charts and graphs they want to use, and the overall layout of the dashboard. Customization allows teams to be more flexible and tailor the dashboard to their specific business objectives.Increased efficiencyÂ A content marketing dashboard doesnât make much sense without a solid data infrastructure behind it. A dashboard development process also includes streamlining data collection, transformation, storing, and loading into the dashboard itself. Marketers often struggle to fulfill all the steps on their own due to the required level of technical expertise. However, with some external help from analysts or third-party vendorsâ automation, the dashboard will be powered with real-time data, leaving marketers more time to focus on campaigns and analysis instead of spending time on gathering data.Additionally, studies have shown that incorporating analytics tools, such as a content marketing dashboard, can lead to greater success in content marketing. A study by Content Marketing Institute found that 84% of the most successful content marketers use analytics tools to manage content. By utilizing a content marketing dashboard, marketing teams can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging real-time data to optimize their strategies, increase accountability, and ultimately achieve their content marketing goals.What Metrics to Include in a Content Marketing DashboardAccording to the 2022 State of Marketing Report by Salesforce, 72% of high-performing marketers analyze marketing performance in real-time. This highlights the importance of having a content marketing dashboard that provides a centralized platform to track and analyze marketing metrics, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions. Letâs take a closer look at metrics used by different roles in various reporting scenarios:Day-to-Day Content Marketing MetricsWeâll start with the content marketing metrics that your team should closely monitor every day. These metrics allow your team to understand how search engines rank their content, how engaging the content is to readers, and how it helps you achieve your goals.ImpressionsÂ This metric shows you how many people are seeing your content. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are getting the most traction and identify the characteristics of the content piece that make it stand out on search engines. On the other hand, a sharp decline in impressions may indicate that the search engine doesnât consider the content piece to be informative or trustworthy. In this case, you have to update it according to the E-A-T principle.Clicks / CTRThis metric shows how many people click on your content. By tracking clicks, you can understand how engaging the contentâs title is. If your piece has a high SERP position but doesnât generate enough traffic, you need to come up with a more catchy title. You can use the chart below as a CTR benchmark for your content pieces. The higher your article is on SERP, the higher the projected CTR is.Bounce rateThis metric shows the percentage of people leaving your site after viewing only one page. By tracking this metric on each content piece, you can identify which pieces of content arenât engaging enough or donât have the required navigational elements to prolong the user journey on your website.Â Marketers who promote products with longer sales cycles should keep a close eye on this metric. The more touchpoints users have with your brand, the more willing they are to buy your product.Keyword rankingThis metric shows how your content ranks for specific keywords. Keyword ranks are extremely important to know the estimated amount of traffic each piece brings to your website and understand how your content compares to competitorsâ pieces.In addition to monitoring your ranks, you can also check competitorsâ keywords. At some point, you might realize that your rivals rank for keywords that arenât covered on your blog. If the keyword cluster is in line with the topic of your blog or website,Â  youâve found yourself a topic to cover and a new opportunity to generate more traffic and leads.Number of backlinks by pageThis metric shows the number of websites linking to your content piece. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are the most shareable and how your backlink profile compares to competitorsâ profiles.Â Backlinks play a significant role in content ranking. Thatâs why, if youâre coming up with a new content piece, you should check the number of backlinks on top-ranking content for your seed keyword. Knowing the number will help you plan the link-building strategy for your piece. Whether youâre paying for backlinks or gathering them organically, itâs important to keep up with competitors.BacklinksLetâs take a more in-depth look at backlinks. Thereâs one important thing to remember: backlinks arenât equal. The quality of the backlinks depends on the linking domain authority, URL strength, the amount of traffic generated by the linking domain, thematic fit, and more.For example, if youâre posting an article on content marketing dashboards (just like the one youâre reading), a backlink from HubSpot would have much more impact than a link from a regular guest-posting website for two main reasons:HubSpot is a trustworthy resource in the marketing field (authority + thematic fit).HubSpot most likely attracts more traffic.Ahrefs offers a lot of metrics to help you measure the backlink potential of different websites and assess the strength of your backlink profile. You can streamline this data to your content marketing dashboard to create a single source of truth for content marketing data.Avg. number of pages per sessionThis metric shows how many pages your visitors view on average during a single session. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are the most engaging and adjust your content strategy accordingly.Metrics for C-level Marketing ExecsNext up are higher-level metrics that can be used in general marketing reports presented to the board or CMOs/VPs of Marketing.Â Revenue attributed by content pieceWhile all the metrics listed above indicate the effectiveness of your content in terms of ranking and SEO, CMOs usually focus on more tangible metrics, such as revenue. Thatâs why a report showing which content pieces bring the most revenue is crucial.MQLs attributed by content pieceTracking qualified leads is as important as tracking revenue. Instead of simply displaying the content pieces that bring the most leads, you can go further and break down those leads into groups. In this way, your dashboard will show which content pieces are popular among small businesses and which attract enterprises. You can use it to track the ROI of your content marketing efforts and adjust your content according to your target audience preferences.Digital velocityDigital velocity metrics show the speed at which accounts go from a lead to the closed/won stage. This indicator will help you understand which content pieces bring audiences that are more aware of your product and are more willing to buy it.Â Pipeline conversion ratesThis metric shows how many leads move through your sales pipeline and convert into paying customers. By tracking this metric, you can identify areas where your pipeline might get clogged and adjust your content strategy accordingly.How to Build a Content Marketing DashboardNow that you know which metrics to include in your content marketing dashboard, let's look at how to build one. There are a few different ways to build a content marketing dashboard, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.Build a content marketing dashboard with manually updated dataSpreadsheets are a tool that requires little to no technical knowledge. That's why they are so popular with most marketers. Teams often use spreadsheets as a single source of truth for their marketing activities. They have to populate tables with metrics gathered manually from different sources, and, unfortunately, that's not a very efficient or scalable way to build a content marketing dashboard. Here's why:Manual data collection: Collecting data from multiple sources and inputting it into a spreadsheet is time-consuming. Each data point has to be manually copied and pasted, which can result in errors and inconsistencies.Limited scalability: As your business grows and your data sources increase, manually updating a spreadsheet becomes more challenging. With more data points to track, it can quickly become overwhelming and difficult to manage. Plus, spreadsheets arenât designed to be a database. When processing tens of thousand data rows, spreadsheets tend to stutter, freeze, or even crash regular office PCs.Lack of real-time insights: Manually updating a spreadsheet can result in a time delay in obtaining the most up-to-date information. As a result, it becomes impossible to make informed decisions when your data has a lag of a few days.Limited customization: A manually updated spreadsheet may not provide the flexibility and customization that some businesses need. They often lack in chart design capabilities and other features compared to visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI.Overall, building a content marketing dashboard using a spreadsheet and manually updated data may be a low-cost, entry-level solution. However, there are more efficient options for businesses that require comprehensive real-time insights.Build a DIY dashboard with API integrationsAnother option to build a content marketing dashboard is using API integrations to pull data from different sources automatically. While this approach automates data collection, it also requires certain technical expertise and resources to maintain. The process of setting up APIs can be complicated, involving programming and review of each APIâs documentation.Â To set up an API integration, developers need to understand API protocols, authentication methods, and endpoint documentation, among other technical aspects. This process can quickly turn into a large time suck and require additional resources to ensure the integrations are working correctly.Â Whatâs even more challenging is maintaining these APIs. Platforms roll out several updates per year for each of their APIs. Developers will also need to keep an eye on these changes, as they may require the codebase to be updated to keep the integration working properly.Â For instance, to extract data from Facebook Ads, marketers need to access Facebook's API documentation, obtain a Facebook app ID and secret key, and create an access token. This requires technical expertise and a clear understanding of the authentication process. Marketers also need to use the appropriate endpoints to extract the desired data, which can be complicated.And donât even get me started on API deprecation, for example, a recent Adwords API sunset. Migrating your current infrastructure to a completely new API is a real pain in the neck.Furthermore, integrating multiple data sources can add a layer of complexity. To access data from different sources, developers must use other API protocols and ensure they are compatible. This may require more development resources, time, and cost.In summary, while building a content marketing dashboard with API integrations certainly automates your data workflow, it also requires technical expertise and considerable development resources.Â Use a third-party reporting toolOne way to build a content marketing dashboard is to use a third-party reporting tool such as Whatagraph.Â It can be a quick and easy way to get a content marketing dashboard up and running. However, these tools often provide limited insights and lack the granularity required to achieve deeper insights out of raw numbers. Users typically have limited options for customizing the dashboard and may be limited to pre-built templates.Â While these tools may work for teams with limited resources or very basic reporting requirements, more advanced marketers may find them too basic and not customizable enough to meet their needs.Use automated marketing analytics platformsAutomated marketing analytics platforms, like Improvado, provide a powerful solution to build a content marketing dashboard.

CentralizationWhile having extensive reports laid out for you to dig into is valuable in specific circumstances, itâs better to have an overview of daily activity. The tricky thing about reports is that theyâre often scattered across the various tools you use to keep your site healthy. Using a Google Analytics Dashboard provides maximum visibility into the most actionable metrics in a centralized location.All you have to do is log in and see the overview.3. TransparencyÂ When running a marketing team, keeping everyone in the loop on what matters most can be challenging. With the ability to visualize actionable metrics in a single location, you may avoid slowed or delayed campaigns and miscommunication. A Google Analytics Dashboard offers transparency and accessible insights at any given time.Â 4. Channel InsightsThe marketing mix with which most companies work in our modern era is complicated. There are many channels to juggle and countless metrics to track. If you keep your analytics from each channel separate from each other, youâll have difficulty getting an overview of your positioning.Â Google Analytics allows you to pull information from different marketing channels and compare them. The relationship between those channels may reveal some of your most vital data to make crucial decisions.5. Funnel VisibilityWe touched on this before, but it canât be stressed enough. Building a marketing funnel is one of the most important undertakings of a marketing executive. If you donât make it trackable and measurable, itâs hard to take advantage of it. Using Google Analytics allows you to see into each stage of your funnel and find where the holes are.Â Itâs also essential to determine how each stage of your funnel works and how it communicates with the others. The customer journey is a crucial conversation, and your data can give you a clear picture of it.

ImpressionsAn impression is when your website, ad, or content is found and loaded. Whenever you place content in front of people, that counts as an impression.

Top KeywordsTracking your top-performing keywords can be a great way to refine your overall marketing strategy.Â The 6 Types of Widgets in Google AnalyticsAs we mentioned above, your Google Analytics Dashboard is a collection of widgets that displays real-time data from your website. Think of a widget as a mini-report that can showcase data in various ways. From simple numeric metrics to complete graphs, you have many options.Â Google Analytics allows you to define the functionality of your widgets within the dashboard itself. Each dashboard can have one or many widgets that display different dimensions and metrics.There are two main types of widgets in Google Analytics. The first is standard widgets, which show you processed data. These are updated whenever you refresh the page or alter the date range.Â âThe second type is real-time widgets. These are the bread-and-butter of your dashboard because, as the name suggests, they display your site data in real time. Real-time widgets update their metrics automatically for active website users. Depending on the widget, they can display Active User or Pageview metrics.Â Now that youâre equipped with the lay of the land, letâs jump into the types of widgets in Google Analytics.1. TimelineA timeline can be either a standard or a real-time widget that displays a graph of the selected metric over a specified period. Typically, the metric uses connected dots to visualize progression or growth over months, weeks, or days (depending on your selections). If itâs a real-time widget, a timeline can display a graph of pageviews on your site for the last 60 seconds or the last 30 minutes.Â 2. MetricsMetrics are another form of standard widgets that show your data as a single value number. This perfect addition to your dashboard displays simple pieces of data in a clear way, such as daily or monthly active users.3. Geo MapThe geomap can be either a standard or a real-time widget that visualizes Google Analytics metrics across an entire map or a selected region. If youâre trying to get an overview of users based on location, the geomap will allow you to get an accurate birds-eye view.4. BarBar widgets are standard widgets that can be useful for showcasing discrete or discontinuous data and showing the relationships between certain parts to the whole. This widget could be used to visualize and compare conversions coming from different traffic sources.5. PiePie charts are standard widgets that display data as a percentage of the whole. This visualization can allow your team to visualize goal ratios by channels and other metrics that require understanding data contributions.6. TablesA table can be either a standard or a real-time widget. Itâs a classic display of data using rows and columns. Standard tables can display the correlation between metrics or provide a deeper look into a specific metric. Real-time tables can plot a table of active users against up to three selected dimensions.3 Ways to Build a Dashboard from Google Analytics DataThe number one benefit of building a dashboard from Google Analytics data is that you can easily see whatâs working and what isnât.

Your submission has been received!Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form.In our modern era, search engines are a gateway to the internet. They act as the spine of society by connecting us to an abundance of knowledge, which is why we rely so heavily on them in our daily lives. When it comes to running a business, itâs essential to understand the ways that search engines impact the lives of your customers.Google is the king of search engines. As of January 2022, Google ranked among the most visited multi-platform web properties in the US, with close to 260 million unique US visitors. Google also holds most of the market share (61.4%) among all leading US search engine providers. The numbers tell the entire story. Google is one of the most prominent features in the daily routines of your customers, which means your business needs to determine how to advertise on the platform.Â This dominance is why Google Ads is crucial for any successful digital marketing campaign and why a Google Ads dashboard can help you see deeper into those campaign efforts. In this article, youâll learn what a Google Ads dashboard is, why your business needs it, and how to set yours up with the metrics required for success.Uncover in-depth insights with customizable marketing dashboardsBOOK A CONSULTATIONWhat Is a Google Ads Dashboard?Google Ads is a service that allows you to promote your business, sell products or services, increase awareness, or drive traffic to your website. This online advertising platform lets advertisers and digital marketing experts bid to display their service offerings, product listings, or landing pages to web users. The platform will place ads in the SERPs of Google, other search engines, other websites, and mobile apps.Â A Google Ads dashboard is a centralized hub where you can track and measure all the most important metrics related to your Google Ads account. You can create these dashboards using external tools like Google Analytics or a reporting tool that pulls in that data. Google Ads is continually offering new ad formats to optimize, so having a tool to pull in all data from different campaigns and efforts automatically can reduce headaches.Google Ads was formerly known as Google Adwords. You might have heard a Google Ads dashboard called an Adwords dashboard or a Google Adwords dashboard. These are interchangeable terms.These dashboards display data directly pulled from Google Ads and compiled into a single secure location. This way, instead of wading through hundreds of rows and columns, you can easily visualize the metrics youâre tracking. Inserting abundant data into an easily digestible format is the best way to make insights actionable.Â Creating a centralized dashboard can be particularly helpful if you manage multiple Google Ads accounts.Â 5 Benefits of a Google Ads DashboardDigital marketing professionals have to deal with many things every month. Tasks include creating content, managing teams, and keeping clients in the loop. All of that can come to a stressful boiling point when the time comes to send reports to your stakeholders.Â 1. Stakeholder CommunicationIf you work for clients, you may have to send hundreds of compiled reports and talk through complicated metrics so that everyone is on the same page. If you work in-house, you might need to send many layered and complex pieces of data to your executive team and stakeholders.Â A Google Ads dashboard can make reporting week significantly easier. If done correctly, a dashboard allows you to communicate the most critical metrics easily. Instead of your stakeholders having to browse through pages or reports, log into multiple tools, and try and understand complex numbers, you can streamline the entire process with a dashboard.Â 2. Internal CommunicationDashboards can also do wonders for internal communication. When managing a marketing team, youâre constantly juggling many components simultaneously. It can be easy to drop the ball when it comes to communication, but the consequences of not being on the same page with your team can be costly.Â Miscommunication can lead to a lack of collaboration on campaigns, delays in content execution, missed deliverables, and stalls in cash flow. With a Google Ads dashboard, you and your team can sync up on your goals and stay in touch with real-time data updates. Since our modern era moves quickly, your website analytics shift rapidly. To make real-time decisions, you need to have real-time updates.Â Your Google Ads dashboard can facilitate that.3. Data VisualizationFor many marketing professionals, the last thing you want to deal with is an abundance of numbers. When delivering on and executing complicated campaigns, you may not have the time to understand the relationship between your number of unique visitors and your conversion rate.Â Data visualization is crucial. Rather than deal with spreadsheets exclusively, you can leverage the power of a visual dashboard. The point of a Google Ads dashboard is to bring your data to life in an easily-digestible way.Â 4. Targeted CampaignsMetrics alone arenât enough to generate actionable insights. The difference between digital marketing professionals who see consistent success and those who feel like their success varies from campaign to campaign is that the former understand this principle.Â Something that sets dashboards apart from spreadsheets is that you can easily visualize the relationship between one metric to another. For example, you can observe the number of unique visitors your site sees in a month next to your conversion rate and determine if thereâs a correlation.Understanding the relationship between metrics can be critical to improving your Google Ads efforts and reporting. It can help you refine your target audience and better target your unique campaigns. Grasping these relationships can also aid your team in updating and further refining existing campaigns.Adopt advanced UTM practices for precise revenue attribution and campaign analysisExplore5. Automated ReportingA Google Ads dashboard automatically updates through an API. It provides you, your team, and your stakeholders with up-to-date information and data. Some of the metrics you pull in will be stagnant, which means they update daily or at designated intervals. Others are real-time, which means your dashboard constantly updates with real-time data for you to make real-time decisions.Â Automation is one of the reasons that your dashboard can be considered your primary source of truth for your organization. This is the pathway forward if youâve been looking to shift into making data-driven decisions. The automated reporting aspect is crucial because you canât commit to making data-driven choices if you donât constantly have a reliable source of truth from which to pull.Â Because Google Ads dashboards offer real-time reporting, it allows marketing professionals to focus on providing their stakeholders with actionable insights and immediate answers.Â What Metrics Should You Include in a Google Ads Dashboard?A Google Ads dashboard is only as effective as the metrics you choose to track. When setting up your dashboard, consider which data pieces are the most impactful to your organization or your stakeholders. Do you need to gather information on a recent campaign or overall website performance? Are you tracking goals? Conversions? Sessions?Once you narrow down your specific intentions, it can help you decide which metrics to include. Here are four metrics we recommend adding to your first Google Ads dashboard to cover the basics.1. ImpressionsYour website impressions are how often a Google Ads paid ad has been encountered on the SERPs. If youâre running a specific campaign to increase awareness, this is one of the most critical metrics to put on your dashboard. Itâs related to the level of interest in search terms related to the brand. You can also use this metric for insights into search volume trends.2. ClicksThis is self-explanatoryâa click is counted each time a user clicks on your website link in an ad. A click might be on the header of the paid search ad or any extensions supported by Google Ads. Those could include elements such as featured products or locations.Â To accurately monitor campaign performance, this is one of those must-have metrics. A click is often a sign that a user is curious enough to learn more about the brandâs offering, be that a product or a service.Â 3. CPCCPC stands for cost-per-click. It refers to the amount youâre charged (on average) for someone to click on a Google Ad. Tracking this metric on your dashboard can be incredibly beneficial because your CPC can change daily. Itâs linked to Googleâs real-time algorithm, so thereâs little benefit to comparing it week-over-week.Â Keeping an eye on this one is helpful, though, because the lower the cost, the more effective your campaign can be at reaching more of your target audience within your designated budget.4. Conversion RateThe conversion rate should be the main target of any campaign. You might already be familiar with your conversion rate, but placing it on your dashboard is an excellent way to visualize how your conversions are affected by other metrics. This is especially true because Google Ads can report on different conversion events, which might include:Â Mobile ad callsPurchasesCustom goalsAnd moreYou can choose to visualize your conversions based on the ad itself, the keyword level, or the campaign level. Keep track of your marketing dollars by including this metric on your dashboard.Â Simplify Google Ads Tracking with ImprovadoIf youâre looking for the best way to streamline Google Ads tracking, Improvado has the solution.

What if, instead of wading through massive amounts of rows and columns, you had a visual representation of the most important metrics to send your stakeholders?Â This can become a reality with an effective web analytics dashboard.Â Businesses gather overwhelming troves of data every day. In fact, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created daily, which amounts to significant web activity. This means businesses must actively monitor said activity in real-time to make time-sensitive decisions based on that data.Â A web analytics dashboard provides a truly centralized location for your marketing analytics. In this article, youâll learn more about what they are, how to build one, and which metrics you should include.What Is a Web Analytics Dashboard?Digital marketing professionals use web analytics dashboards to visualize the health of their websites. These dashboards are handy for tracking performance metrics as well. Many free tools are floating around which supply website owners with a wealth of data, including Google Analytics.Â The problem with having an abundance of information, though, is that itâs often not easy to visualize. Presenting the information that matters most (i.e., actionable data) in a digestible format isnât automatic. This causes issues within the organization. If your team is confused about which metrics to focus on and communication is stunted as a result, operations will lag behind.Imagine what would happen if you could quickly identify critical data points, display them in an easy-to-see way, and communicate that with your entire team.An analytics dashboard is a visual report showcasing your most important performance metrics, such as website traffic, conversion rate, bounce rate, and session duration.Uncover in-depth insights with customizable marketing dashboardsBOOK A CONSULTATIONWhy Build a Web Analytics Dashboard?If youâre wondering why you should bother with a web analytics dashboard to monitor your KPIs, youâre not alone. Many marketing professionals feel similarly at first. However, a dashboard can be one of the most powerful analytics tools you employ to create actionable insights.As a digital marketer responsible for reporting website performance to executives and/or clients, an efficient-yet-effective method of sharing your data is a game-changer.Â Â Enter: a web analytics dashboard.Â There are several common reporting issues a quality dashboard can solve:Your everyday tools might not have reporting thatâs easily accessible.It can be difficult to have all of your stakeholders log into a wide range of tools to gather information.Â Those same tools can require a level of expertise to even be able to understand the results and data they provide.You may not have enough users provisioned for individual logins.It is often necessary to have a centralized location or hub for all the most critical data.Marketing efforts donât always mesh well with your reporting efforts. This can become particularly evident when trying to send multiple stakeholders separate reports on the website, social media, advertising, email marketing, and more.Â Instead, you can include all of that information in one centralized location. Stakeholders can access your real-time dashboard on their own terms as well, which makes for much less stress when it comes to communication at the end of the month.Â Now we come to the best partâhow to build your very own dashboard.5 Important Web Analytics Metrics to Include on Your DashboardA great dashboard is more than the sum of its parts, and thatâs because when all your website metrics are visible in one place, you can accurately understand the relationships between them. Building a great web analytics dashboard means assembling the most important metrics at your website and using them to create actionable insights.Â Here are five web analytics metrics your dashboard should include:1. Number of UsersThis refers to the number of unique visitors your website receives in a given period. This is one of the most important metrics to include on a dashboard, especially when reporting to clients. It measures whether their websiteâs audience is rising, decreasing, or stagnant.However, be careful how you take this metric into account. An influx in unique visitors doesnât necessarily equate to an increase in website audience. Thatâs because a user might visit the site this morning, leave, and come back again the next day, and it would show up as a new unique visit on both days.It all depends on whether or not you set up cross-device tracking.Though itâs not an end-all-be-all metric, itâs very useful to see how many people are visiting the site.2. Number of SessionsMeasuring the number of sessions means tracking a group of user interactions with a site that happen within a certain period. An individual session might have many page views, social interactions, events, and purchases. Think of sessions as the accumulation of actions your visitors take while on your website.Â A single user can have multiple sessions. They can all occur on one day, or over several weeks or months. When one session expires, it frees up another to start.Â Sessions can expire in two different ways:Time: Sessions typically expire at midnight based on your time zone setting, or after 30 minutes of inactivity. You can adjust that as is relevant to your industry or audience.Â Campaigns: If a visitor lands on a website through a certain campaign, exits, and then enters again via a different route, thatâs known as a campaign change.Â By using this metric, youâll be able to identify the customer journey all the way to conversion. If youâve been curious about what events your users carried out while on your siteâand which pages they spend the most time onâthis metric will be valuable to include.Â 3. Goal ConversionsGoal conversions is a metric commonly overlooked, but can be one of the most valuable in your arsenal. This metric allows you to decipher which actions on your website align with your primary objectives. Selecting certain actions or interactions as goals, such as clicking a call-to-action button or filling out a contact form, can profoundly refine your targets.Â As marketing professionals already know, accurately defining your goals is a crucial part of any good digital marketing strategy. If you properly define your objectives, it allows your dashboard to offer more valuable data. Those data options can include conversion rates, and the conversions your specific campaigns are achieving.Â To help your marketing team assess the effectiveness of your existing strategies, add goal conversions to your dashboard.Â 4. Goal ValueIn similar fashion to the aforementioned metric, goal value is the amount you assign to an individual conversion. Each revenue-driven goal has a dollar amount attached, which is recorded each time a user completes such a goal. This lets you track the return on your digital marketing investments.Â Many people make the mistake of assuming this is a metric attached to eCommerce merchants, but thatâs not the case. Any goal you create can have value. When people talk about setting measurable goals, this is one way to ensure success in that endeavor.Figure out the value you put behind each conversion. This will allow you to clearly quantify the return on your marketing investment. If this is the basis for evaluating campaigns as a whole, then you should employ the same logic within each step of the process.Interested in further upping your marketing game? Check out our downloadable guide on advanced UTM practices.Â 5. Conversion RateAny website owner is likely familiar with their conversion rate. Itâs one of the metrics many people attempt to measure but struggle to quantify. If conversion rates have been an issue, a good way to accurately visualize conversion rates is to place them on your web analytics dashboard alongside other metrics to see the entire picture.Â Your conversion rate is the percentage of visitors that convert on an individual page. Itâs a critical KPI as it immediately informs you if people are responding to and engaging with your offering.Â Analyzing conversion rates of specific landing pages is essential in knowing which strategies are the most productive in converting visitors into paying customers. The insights on your dashboard communicate the conversion rate of particular pages; if one is high, you can check out which kinds of design, copy, and offerings are performing well. It can be extremely helpful in narrowing down your target audience personas, too.Â If you find an underperforming page, take a closer look and decide how to get it on par with stronger pages. Testing which elements of a landing page improve conversions is a productive way to yield a return on marketing dollars.Â Conversion rates alone can be difficult to quantify, which is why basing them on goals or traffic sources is helpful. When users finish a goal, the percentage is the conversion rate of that particular goal.Â To explain further, if you have a conversion goal for visitors to click a call-to-action button, then the percentage of visitors who do so on a particular page will be the conversion rate of that specific goal on that particular landing page.Â How to Build a Web Analytics Dashboard in ImprovadoBuilding a web analytics dashboard can be an entirely custom endeavor.

No wonder search engine optimization (SEO) continues to be one of the most widely used marketing tools in the business. But it can be challenging to do well.SEO is a complicated beast, so much so that itâs difficult for executives and clients to understand the value it brings to their marketing efforts. Not to mention the intense competition businesses face when vying for popular keywords.Â Fortunately, all can be made easier with a dedicated SEO dashboard at your fingertips.Â What Is an SEO Dashboard?An SEO dashboard is a third-party SEO KPI reporting interface that gathers all of your SEO analytical data into a single, uniform report. By pulling data from multiple analytics sources, SEO dashboards provide a crystal clear picture of your SEO performance across the web.Â This isnât just a surface-level look at how many keywords youâre ranking for. SEO dashboards offer insights into the most granular details and metrics of an SEO approach, helping you better understand the reality of your link-building strategies, technical SEO specs, session averages, and more.Â 12 best marketing dashboard templates to uncover actionable insights ExploreSEO Dashboard BenefitsIf youâre well-versed in Google Analytics, Moz, and other SEO tools, you may not think you need a separate SEO reporting dashboard. After all, many of these tools are free and offer the same flexibility; what makes an SEO dashboard any different? These four benefits will spell it out for you.Single Source of InformationThe most obvious benefit of an SEO dashboard is the convenience of your data. You wonât have to search for it anymore as it will all be conveniently located in an easy-to-consume interface.Efficient SEO ReportsRelying on free SEO tools might work for you, but compiling an SEO report from all of that data is time-consuming. It can take hours to pull data from each resource and even longer to root out duplicate data sets tracked by multiple SEO tools. An SEO dashboard enables you to pull information from multiple sources in one place to deliver faster reports.Easily Understood Visual ChartsDonât give your decision-makers a long list of numbers to scratch their heads at. SEO dashboards provide thorough and detailed informational charts and graphics to clearly communicate your SEO performance.Detailed Competitor InsightsSEO is all about how you rank compared to the competition. Therefore, no SEO strategy is complete without in-depth competitor analysis insights. Your SEO dashboard provides regular (daily, monthly, weekly, you name it) rank changes and compares those rankings to see exactly how well you stack up to the competition.Metrics to Track in an SEO DashboardThe more data you have on your SEO performance, the better decisions you can make. But which metrics provide the information you need to make the right decisions from your SEO dashboard?Â Organic TrafficOrganic traffic indicates the number of people who start a session on your website from a search engine query. This is directly related to the primary goal of SEO: driving traffic to your website. This metric tells you whether your SEO contributed to a rise (or fall) in website traffic.SEO Ranking ChangeSEO ranking changes are the number of search engine results page (SERP) ranking increases for a given keyword. For example, if your keyword went from ranking 42 on Google to 25, that would be a change of +17. This number looks at all positive and negative changes to give you a quick snapshot of the overall trend of your SEO rankings.Current 1st RankingsCurrent 1st rankings track how many keywords your website currently ranks for in the first position on a search engine. This is the most valuable positionâgarnering 27.6% of all clicks on Google. The more first-position rankings you have, the better your chance of getting more traffic (and conversions).Top Landing PagesTop landing pages are the pages on your website that attract the most traffic. In terms of SEO, this often means these pages are top performers for their keywords or that the content is highly shareable. Whatever the case, knowing which landing pages are the highest performing can help inform your promotion strategy for future campaigns.ConversionsConversions in an SEO dashboard reveal how many conversions on your website came from an organic session. While rankings and organic sessions may help you generate ad revenue, they donât directly contribute to your sales. Therefore, conversion metrics illustrate how effectively your SEO strategy inspires actual sales.Link-Building MetricsLink-building metrics include backlinks gained and lost, which shows how many other websites currently link to yours. Backlinks are a significant ranking factor for SEO, giving Google a general idea of how reliable and relevant your website is.Â CTRClickthrough rate (CTR) refers to how often your links are clicked versus how often theyâre shown. If your search result garnered 25 clicks after showing up 100 times on the SERP, you would have a CTR of 25%. As a frame of reference, the first result on Google usually attracts a 39.6% CTR, more than double the second result (18.4%).Local SEO Ranking ChangeLocal SEO ranking change signifies how many local keywords you currently rank for. This includes keywords and phrases encompassing the city or state in which youâre based. If your company deals with a local audience or has a physical store location, local keywords will help you attract a local audience.Site Audit ScoreSite audit scores alert you to any technical on-site errors which may be affecting how website crawlers scan and index your site. This includes errors like duplicate content, server errors, long load times, and missing meta tags. These unseen elements can have a drastic effect on your SEO performance.Average Review RatingAverage review rating shows you the average star rating of your business on Google. While reviews donât directly contribute to your search engine ranking ability, they give your audience a glimpse into how well-received your company is in the public eye. If you have low reviews, your audience is much less likely to want to check out your services.For a complete picture of how data can (and should) transform your marketing goals, check out our Data Culture in Marketing Analytics guide.Â Best Practices for SEO DashboardsNow that weâve clarified which SEO metrics you need to focus on, itâs time to discuss how you can use your SEO dashboard to the best of your ability. The following are four best practices everyone should use for their dashboard.1. Include KPIs Relevant to Business GoalsPrioritize the KPIs and metrics most relevant to your business goals. If youâre pushing an awareness campaign, focus on CTR and organic traffic. If youâre running an SEO campaign, focus on SEO ranking changes and total first-ranking keywords.Â This doesnât mean you should stop tracking metrics that arenât immediately relevant to your campaignâthey may help diagnose problems in your greater marketing strategy. Just make sure to track the success of your goals according to the appropriate metrics.2. Use Multiple Data SourcesThe whole point of an SEO dashboard is to get more organization out of your data. If youâre just relying on a single source of information, like Google Analytics, you wonât gain any new insights from a consolidated dashboard.If youâre looking for other SEO tools to integrate into your dashboard, consider services like:MOZ to gain fresh insight into your SEO visibility.Skai to evaluate the behavior and demographics of search user groups.Google Analytics 4 to access all of Googleâs inherent search tools (like Search Console).Bing Webmaster Tools to capture your audience using Bing (which currently maintains the second largest market share for search engines).It also helps to keep up with the latest trends in SEO. For example, have you considered how voice search affects your SEO capabilities? The rising popularity of voice assistants has led many to focus on more conversational keywords and create FAQ content.3. Make Reports Easy to DigestItâs essential to clearly communicate your findings in all of your reports. SEO dashboards allow you to attach notes and comments to build a story around your data. This helps you summarize essential information, define terminology, and insert actionable insights regarding your data.Be sure to use plenty of charts and graphs in your report! Data visualization is critical for improving understanding and defining the bigger picture of your data.4. Donât Use Technical JargonWhen delivering your reports, try to limit the amount of technical jargon. While technical terms may be correct and accurate, using too many can be exhaustive to get throughâespecially for your decision-makers who may be unfamiliar with SEO basics. Spell out acronyms, use synonyms whenever possible, and err on the side of over-explanation just to be safe.Uncover In-Depth SEO Insights with ImprovadoDeveloping an optimized SEO dashboard doesnât have to be a huge burdenâespecially when you partner with Improvado to do it for you.Â How to Set Up an Improvado-Powered SEO DashboardImprovado is an advanced marketing analytics solution that builds upon your existing business intelligence (BI) tools to ensure your operating platform is familiar, like Google Data Studio.

Data analysis tells you if youâve reached the right audience, if your message resonates, and if youâve inspired the intended actionâall data that are useful for other parts of your business as well.Of course, this analysis is only as effective as your data collection method. Thanks to modern technology, that data collection is easier than ever before with the advent of LinkedIn Ads dashboards.These tools are your greatest ally, which is why weâve created this intensive guide.Â What Is a LinkedIn Ads Dashboard?An example of LinkedIn Ads dashboardA LinkedIn Ads dashboard is a third-party advertising analytics tool that pulls information from your LinkedIn Ads account to track campaign analytics data from the platform. You can also pull data from other social platforms directly into the same dashboard.Â Think of LinkedIn Ads dashboards as the hotline for the results of your social media campaigns. The dashboard offers a high-level overview of your campaign performance, displaying every tracked metric and KPI from your paid social campaigns. This delivers insights into your audience engagement, conversions, and the general ROI of your ad spend (among many other metrics).12 best marketing dashboard templates to uncover actionable insights ExploreBenefits of a LinkedIn DashboardBuilding a unified dashboard for your LinkedIn marketing efforts is a no-brainer. Letâs break down the four primary benefits of a LinkedIn Dashboard.1. A Single Source of ReferenceLinkedIn ad analytics shouldnât be a scavenger huntâyou want all of your data in one place so you can make quick, data-backed decisions. With dashboards, you no longer need to navigate between separate analytic profiles and spreadsheets.Â Every bit of data you need to look at is housed in the dashboard. Consider the finite details of individual campaigns one second and assess how it fits into the larger marketing picture the next.2. Full TransparencyThe transparency benefit here is two-fold: data transparency and communication transparency between teams.The first is obviousâwhen all of your advertising data is on a single dashboard, you gain a clear understanding of how your advertising efforts perform.Â Meanwhile, teams can achieve greater transparency in their communications through permission and sharing settings on your dashboard. Giving all applicable personnel access to your data metrics ensures your team remains aligned with your social media goals.3. Data IntegrationYou donât have to dedicate your dashboard to LinkedIn-exclusive data. If youâre promoting your product and services on other platforms, your dashboard can house that additional data so you gain a greater glimpse into the reality of your ad performance across the web.4. Complete CustomizationPerhaps the greatest benefit of a LinkedIn reporting dashboard is its ability to customize every tracked metric according to your needs. You wonât need to sift through data sets and performance indicators you donât care about.Â What Metrics Should You Include in a LinkedIn Ads Dashboard?With so many metrics you could track, itâs easy to get lost in the proverbial weeds of analytics. So which metrics should you focus on in your LinkedIn Ads dashboard?Â Ad ClicksAd clicks are the total number of clicks on your ads. This includes clicks on parts of the ad that send users to your website or other intended destinations. It does not track engagement metrics, including likes, comments, or shares.Ad ImpressionsAd impressions are the total number of people who saw your ad. Impressions give you a good sense of how prevalent your ads are in the public sphere, but donât offer a good indication of engagement on their own.Ad SpendAd spend is the total amount of money youâve spent on promoting your ads and posts on LinkedIn and other platforms. This metric is usually updated in real-time, so you have a complete understanding of how much budget you have left in a month.Campaign EngagementCampaign engagement is the combined total of likes, comments, shares, and other engagement metrics on the LinkedIn posts associated with your campaign. You may segment these metrics by individual posts or lump specific posts into more refined categories.Â CTRHow many people navigated to your website because they saw your ad? Your click-thru-rate (CTR) answers this question. CTR is usually presented as a percentage of people who clicked on your ad vs the total number of impressions.Â CPMCost per thousand (CPM) is the amount you pay for every thousand impressions. This is usually a set fee established by the platform youâre advertising on. Referring to this number frequently can help determine whether your ROI is acceptable.Â Total ConversionsTotal conversions is the total number of individuals who converted on your website during the duration of your campaign.Conversion RateThe conversion rate is the percentage of clicks that resulted in a conversion. This divides the total conversions by the total clicks on your ad. You can set the conversion to be whatever best fits your campaign, whether that be a PDF download, a purchase, or signing up for your email list.ROASReturn on ad spend (ROAS) calculates the percentage of revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising. This divides the revenue generated from conversions by the total dollar amount spent on advertising.Â CPCSimilar to ROAS, cost per conversion (CPC) calculates the average amount of money you spent on each conversion. This takes into account the total number of conversions compared to the total ad spend, rather than looking at the revenue generated from conversions.This may seem like a lot to track. But we promise itâs worth itâthe more data you have at your disposal, the clearer the picture you can paint of your campaignâs efficacy.What Type of Visualizations Work Best for a LinkedIn Ads Dashboard?Your LinkedIn Ad dashboard will also carry with it a variety of data visualization options, though some are more applicable in certain scenarios than others. These charts and maps arenât just to make your data look prettyâthey help communicate the story your data tells in your marketing reports.Â Here are some of the most common types of visualizations (and when theyâre most appropriate to use).Bar ChartsBar charts are best for comparing multiple values side by side. You may find this useful for comparing the performance of two different campaigns. Or, you might use them to determine which days of the week your ads performed the best.Stacked bar charts also reveal how variables contribute to a specific cause. Say you want to know which social posts contributed the most conversions. A stacked bar graph would showcase your total conversions and clearly illustrate which ad performed the best.Line ChartsWhen you wish to track a metric over time, line charts are your best friend. This visualization tool plots out all your data points across time, making it easy to spot time-based trends and dynamics. You may notice your engagement peaks on a certain day or drops at other times.Alternatively, you may stack two or more line charts on top of each other to compare a month-to-month metric between two separate years. This format also allows for area charts, which highlight the difference between two line charts.Summary ChartsSummary charts are simple displays of a single numeric value. This can be any value you want to take at face value, such as monthly ad spend or current click-through rates. While summary charts donât offer a lot in the way of comparative analysis, they provide a quick snapshot of your campaign analytics.Pie ChartsPie charts offer similar value as stacked bar charts, illustrating how individual pieces of a campaign contribute toward the total value. If you wanted to know how many clicks your ads generated, a pie chart would also show you how those clicks were distributed across all of your posts. This might inform future decisions about which type of posts should be prioritized to garner the largest amount of clicks.Geo MapsGeo maps show you where your audience is. If you only serve a single country, this map may not be of much value. But if your service reaches across international borders, a geo map will show you which areas interact with your content the most.Â This may inspire you to double down and customize your messaging around those high-performing regions. Or you may want to try to service the regions that arenât interacting with your posts as much to expand your reach.LinkedIn Ads Dashboard Best PracticesNow for the most important question: How do you use these metrics to optimize your LinkedIn Ads dashboard? Here are four best practices to inform your strategy.1. Pick the Right MetricsThe list weâve curated above is a great starting point for picking the right metrics on your LinkedIn Ads dashboard. We donât recommend removing any of these metrics, but there are other KPIs you might consider adding.Â For example, many companies like to look at valid/viewable impressions (50% of the postâs pixels are visible for at least two continuous seconds) to gain a greater understanding of their reach.Also, choose to focus on specific metrics that complement the type of campaign youâre running. If itâs an awareness campaign, for example, impressions and clicks may be the most useful metrics. But if youâre aiming for sales, look at total conversions and conversion rates.Â 2. Automate Data SyncsYour dashboard is only as useful as the data it carries. If you forget to sync your dashboard with your platforms, your team may make the wrong decisions because they canât see the full picture.Â Fortunately, you donât have to remember to sync your dataâit can be done automatically. Make sure you set up automatic data syncs between your LinkedIn Ad dashboard and all relevant platforms so you only work with the most up-to-date information.3. Use Data to Make DecisionsThe best decisions are made with accurate data. Itâs not enough to rely on a hunch. Focus on the story the data tells youâWhat type of posts do people resonate with? Where is your audience falling out of your sales funnel?Â Use this data to inform all of your LinkedIn marketing decisions. When choosing to promote a post on LinkedIn with PPC (pay-per-click), check your data to see which ads and posts already receive a lot of attention. If people arenât engaging with a post, a paid promotion wonât convince them otherwise.4. Link Results to Ad SpendMarketing revolves around a budget. Make your monthly ad spend a central discussion in your marketing endeavors. Do you see more success when you spend more on marketing?Â You may run an analysis comparing monthly ad spend to monthly conversions. If thereâs a strong, positive correlation, it could be worth doubling down on your budget.Â Unlock 10x ROAS potential with our Marketing Data Centralization GuideDrive Higher ROAS with an Improvado-Built LinkedIn Ads DashboardReporting gets delayed when you canât find the data you need.

It allows you to improve your processes, products, and operations to build a business thatâs better than the competition. But data is also fragile, and without proper data governance, data integrity can be compromised.In this blog post, weâll talk about one of the major reasons for data integrity issues: data silos. Letâs delve into what they are, why they exist, and how to break them down.Key TakeawaysData silos are data that an individual or department maintains that others in the organization cannot access.Growing organizations, poor data culture, and a lack of the right technology are the main causes of siloed data.Data silos are problematic because they limit business visibility, threaten data integrity, waste company resources, create a less collaborative environment, lead to poor customer experience, and compromise data security.Some common symptoms of siloed data are slow time-to-insight or frustrated employees due to the lack of business visibility.Breaking down data silos is a long and challenging process. You can make this smoother by using automation platforms, like an ETL pipeline that extracts data from different sources,Â  transforms it, and pushes it to a single source of truth (SSOT).What Are Data Silos?Think of data silos as islands of business data that belong to a department or even an individualâand cannot be accessed by others in the organization. This results in isolated information that eventually corrupts the organizationâs data quality.Why Do Data Silos Exist?No one starts out planning to make data silos. But some organizations are more susceptible to them.Â The organizational structure lends itself to siloed dataBusinesses often benefit from a separation of responsibilities. But departmentation can lead to the isolation of some data. With each department collecting its own data for its own purpose, they inadvertently create data silos.The business does not have a good data quality cultureOrganizations with an immature data culture are more likely to have data silo problems. These companies usually lack documentation and data governance, so thereâs no shared understanding of collecting, managing, and storing data.This results in employees without proper guidance on sharing the data they collect.Establish a strong data culture in your organization FREE GUIDETechnology is curbing data quality effortsTechnology can sometimes sabotage an organizationâs efforts to maintain good-quality data.Â When a business uses various software to run its operations, these different pieces of software may not be compatible with each other. This complicates data sharing.Alternatively, some organizations lack access to technology that prioritizes communication between different data sources, inevitably leading to data silo issues.Business growth weakens data management practicesBusiness growth leads to the formation of new departments, new employees, new processes, and new software to support the expanding business.When data management is not a priority, all these recent changes leave individuals making things up as they go alongâwhich almost always leads to data quality issues, particularly data silos.Common Examples of Data SilosData doesnât sit in silos by itself. Itâs the actions we take that put data into silos. Hereâs a review of the common use cases when organizations limit data accessibility (most often unintentionally).Â Using spreadsheets in most business operationsSpreadsheets are still the most popular tool to process, query, and democratize data in many companies. Even though they often become a pain in the neck for data teams.Non-technical specialists (e.g., marketers or financial officers) master spreadsheet formulas and do incredible things with a single VLOOKUP.Despite their ease of use, spreadsheets often become a graveyard for data. After making the required queries, data gets lost on someoneâs cloud and doesnât reach centralized storage.A spreadsheet also becomes a data silo when it moves from prototype to production. If some of your business logic revolves around spreadsheets, itâs a clear sign that you have to come up with something more practical. There are multiple reasons to avoid spreadsheets, ranging from data caps to an inability to include each spreadsheet in a data governance process.How to unsilo your data from spreadsheets: Start with reviewing gigantic spreadsheets that are fundamental for some of your business operations. Theyâre most likely inefficient due to their size and the numerous macros and formulas sitting on top of them.Â Finding a way to transfer data to a more sustainable architecture, such as a cloud data warehouse, will improve the data accessibility and individual performance of each employee who interacts with the data.Poorly structured transformation queriesWhen aggregating different types of data, such as financial, marketing, and sales data, to create a single source of truth, things get a little messy.First, different data has different naming conventions that have to be aligned to make sense. Plus, you have to create additional queries on top of previous ones to create ad-hoc reports on campaign performance, revenue growth, and so on.Eventually, you end up having a three-page long SQL query that makes sense only to its owner. Your transformation jobs might be so complex that a part of the required data simply doesnât reach the data pipeline.The worst part is that analysts can spot the drastic decrease/increase in metrics, but they canât understand the reason behind it because they canât figure out how this data was queried.How to unsilo your data from complex queries: The issue can be approached in two different ways.Â If your company performs transformations in-house, break up complex queries into multiple checkpoints and store them in tables for an intermediate data quality check. Clearly defined transformation steps and verification of data quality after each step ensure that none of the data slips away from the pipeline.Another option is to use automated transformation solutions for different types of data. For example, Improvado, an automated marketing data pipeline, transforms all data according to predefined recipes. You can choose any recipe and know exactly what your data will look like after the transformation process.Â Improvado also allows you to create your own SQL-like transformation queries in a no-code, spreadsheet-like interface. You can clearly see the dependencies between different data entries and transform data in any way you need, without writing any SQL queries.Third-party solutions that keep your data hostageTodayâs market is full of ETL solutions that can extract your data from any source, transform it into a digestible format, and display it in insightful dashboards. However, most of these solutions have a major drawback: vendor lock-in.Letâs take Datorama (Salesforce Marketing Cloud) as an example. Itâs a comprehensive solution for large companies that automates marketing reporting and streamlines data from hundreds of sources. From the first glance, itâs each marketerâs dream. It features ad-hoc reports on data from all popular ad platforms.Â Things get complicated if viewed from a data silos angle. You canât load data from Datorama to your in-house storage or merge this data with third-party insights gathered on your side. In other words, you become pretty locked in with data available only in Datorama, and you canât share useful insights outside of the platform as well.This vendor lock-in makes you dependent on the vendor and vulnerable to any changes in pricing policy. If you donât agree with pricing changes, you canât simply give up on the platform, because you lose all of the historical data youâve accumulated. Thatâs why you have to think twice before entrusting your data to such platforms.How to save your data from being trapped: If you decide to go with a third-party platform, choose a vendor that gives you full access to your data.Â Yet again, letâs take a look at Improvado. It offers you different ways to store your data. It can be loaded either to your cloud data warehouse, such as Google Big Query, or you can query your data from Improvadoâs environment. If you donât have your own data warehouse or expertise to manage one, Improvado offers data warehouse management services.This way, you know that your data will stay with you under any circumstances and you can make it fully accessible to any employee in your company.With Improvado, your data is secure, harmonized, and ready for analysisBOOK A CONSULTATIONWhy Are Data Silos Problematic?Data silos are a very common problem with far-reaching organizational and business implications.Limit business visibilityWhen relevant business data canât be connected to a central database, the insights that decision-makers arrive at will not reflect the true state of business operations. This may contribute to business decisions that do more harm than good.Also, when analysts need data that is not easily accessible, it will take them a lot of time to find it from different places. This reduces time-to-insights, the average time it takes to derive actionable insights, and slows down business agility.Some insights can completely slip away from analytics without data exchange between departments.Â For example, how will you attribute leads to revenue and identify the best-performing channels without sales and marketing alignment? Or, how will you know your customers' LTV without information from the customer success team?Â Undermine data integrityData silos result in incomplete business data, which jeopardizes data integrity.This can lead to poor business decisions at the very least or big disasters at the worstâas NASA learned after they lost the Mars Climate Orbiter because two departments failed to communicate that they were using different units of measurement.Even if youâre not working in the aerospace industry, youâre still vulnerable to biases caused by data silos. Imagine a marketing department that tries to optimize campaigns for revenue without relevant sales data. The whole optimization becomes solely guesswork.Â Waste business resourcesData storage costs can be prohibitively expensive. Because many data silos store similar or outdated data, your organization is allocating budgetary resources to data storage that no longer serves the organization.Down the line, business decisions based on this data may even hurt business revenue. For example, if you have inaccurate data during a product launch, your email service provider (EMS) might send the wrong email to customers. Or to the wrong segment, or on the wrong day. This not only destroys customer trust but also affects ROI.Reduce employee collaborationData that is not freely shared can create conflict between employees and departments.Let's say you want to know if the new messaging resonates and gets across to leads. For this, you need to assess the lead quality and verify the leads to sales conversion rate.What if it takes a long time to get this data from sales, if at all, slowing down your processes? This potentially kick-starts terrible feelings between you and your contact point in the sales department. Similarly, a lack of data transparency hinders collaboration between different departments. They become their own little islands where good ideas die because collaboration and cooperation are not encouraged.Amplify poor customer experienceEvery time customers engage with a business, there's a piece of software that can record that interaction.Now imagine if there were no way to connect the data between these different tools. A lot of the data would get siloed, and you would have a terrible time figuring out which part of the customer journey to optimize and how you could personalize every customer engagement.This would further lead to a disjointed customer experience that would push them away from your brand.Compromise data securityWhen data is stored in someone's digital folder, which is inaccessible by a centralized data security network, it becomes difficult for organizations to put security measures into these archives. You will have no control over user permissions, which increases the threat of data breaches.How Do You Know You Have Data Silo Problems?Data silo problems often manifest themselves in day-to-day business operations. They affect everyone at all levels, from decision-makers to frontline employees.Top executives will take a long time to get the information they need to make decisions. They wonât know which levers to pull to achieve business goals. This lack of visibility on industry trends means theyâre often slow to respond to changing customer needs.A lack of sales and marketing alignment can also be a symptom of data silo problems. When individuals feel like theyâre not given access to relevant data to perform their job, itâs convenient to point fingers at other employees who are âwithholdingâ the information. This often leads to unhealthy competition and a toxic work environment, not to mention poor performance and revenue loss.How to Break Down Data SilosBreaking down data silos can be one of the most challenging tasks there is for businesses. Theyâre so ingrained in the company culture that theyâre tough to eliminate. Breaking them down has to be a top-down initiative and a company-wide education program. Accept they existData silos can happen to any organization. The quicker your company accepts this, the sooner you'll take the steps necessary to eliminate them.Figure out how decisions are made in your organizationThe primary goal of data in any organization is to make better decisions. So, to understand the data flow inside your company, you first need to clearly define the decision-making process.Chris Ortega, CEO of Fresh FP&A and a noticeable finance influencer, suggests using a framework called the Decision Cycle. According to this framework, the decision cycle breaks decisions down into five core pillars:Â ProcessesDataInformationKnowledgeBusiness decisionsThese pillars are interlinked with each other. In other words, processes drive data. Data is then turned into information. In turn, that information becomes knowledge that influences all business decisions.Â When you realize how decisions are made inside your organization, you can then identify data silos across departments and find the right technologies to automate the process of converting data to knowledge and reduce friction in the decision-making process.Identify the data silos in your organizationIdentify the root cause of your data silo problems. Is it the company culture? The technology? The processes? Then make a plan to consolidate, replace, or manage them.If you have siloed data inside the organization, your departments are probably functioning as separate business units. That means you need to identify any siloed data inside of each department.Â Here are some signs that indicate youâre on the right track:A department often complains about a lack of data for particular business activities.There is insufficient data to understand the departmentâs influence on the companyâs business processes (imagine a single puzzle piece missing in the holistic picture of your companyâs efforts).There is uncertainty about the success metrics of a particular department.There is an inability to quickly access the department's data.Also, contact your IT team to get a list of the systems used by each department to better understand where the data goes missing.Â Identify the data needs of the different departments and individualsList the different teams who need data and figure out what they need and why they need it. Then identify which other departments already record that data and how they're recording it.Integrate all data and applicationsFigure out a way to get different business applications to communicate with each other. Can you combine some applications? Is there any software that makes sharing data difficult? Can you replace any of the tools youâre currently using?Once you figure this out, build one source of truth for all the data your organization collects. Leverage flexible and scalable tools, like an ETL platform that helps break down data silos, transforms the data into one format, and loads the unified data to a data warehouse.Add business context to your dataData itself is a very technical concept. There are tables, joins, unions, and a lot more technical jargon. But when it comes to business processes, your data must have a business context.Â Imagine a database table named âcost-flowchart-1.XMLâ. It doesnât sound like something of great value to a non-technical person. But when everyone knows that this table is a cost center hierarchy or a chart of leads attracted during the quarter, it gets a certain meaning.Unsiloed data is a company-wide asset, not just a set of numbers for data engineers. So, it should be easy to read for anyone interacting with it.Â As Jagdish Sahasrabudhe, SVP of Business Applications and Platform at SAP, said in his recent talk: âOnly when you have context and semantics assigned to data, thatâs what brings that data closer to a business process. Without that, itâs just a bunch of bits and bytes.âDevelop a strategy for unsiloed dataMaking your data accessible is great by default. But, on a grander scale, you need to ask yourself a question: âWhy does my company need it?âIt might be a jumpstart toward innovation, as well as an initiative that failed to deliver any results. And the only difference between these outcomes is the strategy.You might consider finding a partner to fill in the experience and strategy gaps when it comes to using your data to drive innovation. Instead of shouldering this responsibility on you or your colleagues, why not delegate it to a team that has helped multiple companies across different industries?Through the Professional Services framework, Improvado goes from vendor to partner and helps client teams build insightful dashboards and make informed decisions based on available data. Itâs important to have guidance and expertise on your side early on in the process to have a clear strategy of what to do with your new data.Develop and mobilize your data quality programData quality is often viewed as an IT problem, but, in reality, itâs a shared responsibility. Encourage data ownership, so everyone is responsible for creating and storing good-quality data. To ensure the success of your data governance program, make it clear and easy to understand for everyone in the company.Â Lastly, make data transparency a valuable aspect of the business. Stop the culture of competition between departments and emphasize the importance of collaboration toward business growth.Manage your new data cultureGetting a new data quality system off the ground can take time. Some employees might go back to old practices or get confused about what they should do.Prepare for these drawbacks. Be flexible in how you manage data going forward while the team is getting used to your new approach to data management.Your TurnBreaking down data silos should be part of a complete data management program. When you have regulations in place for exactly how your organization collects, manages, and stores data, data silos are less likely to happen.Get an integrated view of all data across your marketing organizationExploreEvaluating the success of a marketing campaign is one of the most important things marketers need to do to determine whether their efforts are positively impacting the bottom line.Â By focusing on a metric known as return on marketing investment (ROMI), you can develop a strong sense of what's generating new revenue and what isn't. Backed by this data, you can optimize your marketing activities to provide better returns for less money and decide on a budget allocation for higher efficiency.Â In this post, we'll cover precisely what ROMI is, how you can calculate it, and show you how to improve it.Key TakeawaysIt can be challenging to assess your marketing efforts' effectiveness, making it hard for you to decide how you should approach marketing in the future.Â ROMI can help you calculate the return on your marketing, partly helping you solve the issue of identifying the outcomes associated with your activities.Â Measuring ROMI is difficult due to the omnichannel marketing landscape, issues with data collection, and problems with weighting touchpoints.Â Tools like Improvado can help you overcome the challenges of measuring marketing ROI and ensure transparency across the customer journey.Â If you want to improve your marketing ROI, you need to set goals, define core metrics, experiment with channels, implement analytics and track KPIs.Â 12 best marketing dashboard examples to boost your performance and ROMI [Explore]What Is Marketing ROI?Return on marketing investment (ROMI), also known as marketing ROI, is a metric used to determine how much revenue marketing efforts generate compared to how much was spent on it. It's usually calculated in regard to a specific marketing activity, channel, or the brand's overall marketing efforts.Â ROMI is yet another tool to predict future cash flow, make better decisions on budget allocation, and compare the marketing efficiency of different sets of activities.Â How Is ROMI Calculated?You'll need to know revenue and marketing expenses to calculate the return on marketing investment.You then need to put these figures into this formula:Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) = (Revenue attributable to a specific activity - Marketing Expenses) Ã· (Marketing Expenses) Ã 100While the formula looks straightforward, it can be hard to decide what figures to use. For example, what is counted as marketing expenses for running a social media ad? Ad spend? Ad spend and the resources required to create the visual and copy? Should you consider the cost of the software used to create and distribute your ad?To get an accurate ROMI, you need to calculate the full cost of your marketing activity, including production costs, human resources, promotional cost, media spend, software cost, and anything else that comes with launching a certain activity.Â While calculating returns, you also need to establish a sales baseline, since not all sales growth is a result of marketing efforts. It can also help you to get a realistic perspective on ROMI if your company doesnât have clear revenue attribution modeling.Â A sales baseline shows the organic sales growthâhow much profit a company would generate without any marketing spend. Anything above the baseline can be attributed to marketing investments.Â Â Â In a nutshell, the ROMI formula would look like:ROMI = (Sales Growth - Sales Baseline - Marketing Cost) / Marketing CostÂ Â Another important thing to remember while calculating return on marketing investment is conversion lag. Not all marketing activities bring immediate returns. SEO, content marketing, organic social, and other long-term strategies take time to build up. When calculating ROMI, account for a lag between marketing spend and returns. Otherwise, you risk misinterpreting the results and cutting off strategies that might generate a long-term impact.Â Lastly, conversions rarely happen on the spot, it's usually a result of multiple customer touchpoints. Since returns require multiple marketing activities, ROMI should be attributed across all touches along the customer journey. By attributing credit to the last touchpoint, you'll end up with a disproportionately high or low ROMI and, once again, cut off activities that contribute to triggering prospects to advance through the customer journey.Â Choose the right attribution model for your marketing goalsFREE GUIDEHow Is Marketing ROI Used by Companies?Accurate and relevant ROMI calculations will ultimately answer two questions. Are your marketing investments paying off? And how do marketing activities affect revenue objectives?Â This data can serve several purposes for a business:Â Optimizing marketing efforts: ROMI will tell you which of your marketing activities are working and which arenât. Knowing this, you can optimize your marketing budget to focus on activities that are affecting your bottom line.Â Marketing budgeting: Since ROMI highlights which marketing efforts are bringing revenue, you can also use it to justify the budget and how you allocated your spend.Comparing marketing efforts against competitors: If you have ROMI data, you can benchmark it against industry standards and publicly available competitor data to quickly gauge your success and adjust efforts to maximize the impact of your activities.Projecting: Knowing what returns your activities and channels bring, you can use this data to make predictions for future similar initiatives and make strategic decisions on what efforts to implement.How High Should Your ROMI Be?A ROMI should be around a 5:1 ratio, and a fantastic ROMI would be near a 10:1 ratio. Anything above the 10:1 ratio is possible but can be expected on a regular basis.Â A 2:1 ratio is considered the absolute minimum you can aim for. A 2:1 ROMI wouldn't be profitable for most businesses unless you have a high gross margin product.Â This benchmark can vary depending on your cost structure, industry, and marketing activities.For example, the benchmarks for Google Ads tend to vary from the ones used for SEO. If you develop high-level competence in a certain marketing channel, your ROMI for that channel can hit exceptional levels and exceed industry standards.Â So, if you focus on Google Ads, you might learn how to use all of the features on offer. You may then be able to target your ads with extreme precision, minimizing wasted ad spend. This will then lead to better results for less money, which improves ROMI.Â It's also worth mentioning that B2B firms will face different benchmarks than B2C companies. This variation between B2B and B2C often comes down to the differences in marketing tactics each sector can use and the variation in business costs.Â Are ROI, ROMI, and ROAS Different?Some resources use the terms ROI, ROMI, and ROAS interchangeablyâeven though they relate to different things.Â ROI stands for return on investment, and it's calculated using the formula:Â ROI = (Return - Investment Ã· Investment) Ã 100What counts as an investment in this formula can be broad. It doesn't have to include marketing, as you could calculate the ROI of my many different things or activities.Â ROMI is a more specific figure than ROI, as it calculates the returns on investments in marketing.ROAS stands for return on ad spend, and itâs calculated using the formula:ROAS = Conversion Value / Cost of Ad CampaignROAS shows how much money your advertising budget generates.Â You can use ROAS if your marketing efforts are based on paid activities (such as advertising). If you also do non-paid activities, such as SEO or content marketing, your ROAS and ROMI figures might differâmeaning you can use both simultaneously.Challenges of Measuring ROMI and How to Overcome ThemAs discussed earlier, customers rarely take a linear path when making a purchase.Someone might click your Facebook ad, visit your website, sign up to your email list, receive a newsletter mentioning a sale, click on the link in the email, and check out your offering. They may do all this on a desktop and finally switch to their iPhone to purchase and pay with Apple Pay for convenience.If you're not tracking all of this correctly, it's going to look like the customer went straight to your website and bought a product. This can lead to an incorrect ROMI calculation, tainting future decisions based on this data.Â This highlights the importance of having the right marketing and analytics stack to monitor your activities across all channels and links them to the revenue your brand generates.Â Improvado, an advanced marketing solution, can help your marketing department easily track all your marketing efforts and channels, build dashboards, and generate reports on key metrics, like ROMI.The platform aggregates data from 300+ marketing and sales systems to track every customer touchpoint along the journey and match up the costs and revenue associated with each touch.

Imagine your company is entering a new market, and your marketing department launches brand awareness campaigns across multiple channels. These campaigns may show high user engagement and bring traffic to the website but result in a low number of purchases.Â The campaigns' ROMI may be low, but they will make other acquisition campaigns easier in the future.Experiment with channels and campaignsOne of the ways you can try to improve your ROMI is by experimenting with the campaigns and channels. Broadly speaking, you can try new marketing channels and see if they can help boost your ROMI of the overall marketing mix. You can also try campaigns and mediums you havenât used before and see if that does the trick.Implement analytics and track KPIsA great way to tell if you're doing an excellent job of improving ROMI is by tracking KPIs and metrics.For example, if you want to track the email marketing channel, relevant metrics associated with this channel could include open rates, click-through rates, and deliverability.You need to collect various email marketing data, transform it, and load it to an email marketing dashboard that can automate analytics across the hundreds of email campaigns you're running.Bottom LineÂ Measuring return on marketing investment is an effective way to drive a data-driven marketing strategy and keep your marketing department aligned with your company revenue goals. But ROMI is only instrumental when calculated accurately.Â
